02:35.400: watch it the truth is sax why don't 
02:37.560: you admit to everyone that where you're 
02:39.060: show you probably watch it four or 
02:40.680: five times 
02:42.620: all right so let's kick this off 
02:45.319: obviously you guys recorded right before 
02:48.840: the Wagner group attempted coup or 
02:51.900: potential coup or theorized coup began 
02:54.300: last week so sax you kind of sent out 
02:56.940: text saying the show is already stale 
02:59.220: because you know kind of missed that uh 
03:01.140: that news cycle by publishing right 
03:04.319: after it started but you recorded right 
03:05.879: before so let's do 
03:08.819: just quick recap of what happened with 
03:12.120: Russia 
03:13.099: Ukraine and particularly it's Wagner 
03:15.300: Wagner group Rebellion 
03:17.459: last Friday the Wagner Group which is 
03:19.680: Russian paramilitary organization led by 
03:21.840: Evgeni pregosian launched what seemed 
03:25.260: like an armed Insurrection against 
03:26.760: Russia Wagner had occupied portions of 
03:29.040: rostov vondan city of over million 
03:30.900: people regional capital and 
03:32.280: headquarters of Russia's Southern 
03:33.540: military District before setting off 
03:36.000: towards Moscow and then abruptly 
03:38.519: stopping think about 200 kilometers 
03:40.980: before reaching Moscow City at that 
03:43.140: point there was supposedly negotiation 
03:47.120: the president of Belarus got involved 
03:50.120: and pregosian decided to step down Putin 
03:54.299: said I'm not going to persecute or I'm 
03:55.920: not going to prosecute you for these 
03:57.420: crimes he was given immunity and it was 
04:00.060: announced that all the members of the 
04:02.220: Wagner group were given the option of 
04:05.159: returning home or joining the Russian 
04:06.840: military and the Wagner group was going 
04:08.220: be dissolved sax maybe you can kind 
04:11.099: give us your summary of the events 
04:12.900: that took place 
04:14.939: and then we'll talk little bit about 
04:16.380: the interpretation of what we think this 
04:18.720: means for the conflict in Ukraine well 
04:20.880: you're right that this Rebellion took 
04:24.000: place just after we dropped our last 
04:26.100: episode and so everybody both on Twitter 
04:29.280: and in the comments was dunking on me 
04:31.199: for my take on last week's episode that 
04:33.600: the much hyped Ukrainian 
04:35.940: counter-offensive was was not succeeding 
04:38.160: that it was in fact failing think 
04:40.560: there's abundant evidence for that which 
04:42.180: hasn't changed even CNN had written an 
04:44.940: article basically supporting the idea 
04:46.320: that the counter-offensive was not 
04:47.699: living up to what had been promised and 
04:50.220: everyone was in the comments saying 
04:52.199: that my take had basically aged like 
04:53.880: milk and this armed Rebellion or Mutiny 
04:57.540: fregosian was evidence that the 
04:59.280: Russian regime was about to collapse 
05:00.720: that Russia was 
05:02.699: fact on the verge of Civil War and 
05:06.900: you saw the exact same people who had 
05:08.699: oversold the counter-offensive now 
05:10.380: overselling this Mutiny as something 
05:13.500: that would bring down the Russian 
05:15.300: regime and and the war and of course 
05:17.340: that that did not happen 
05:19.080: was certainly highly unusual event 
05:21.540: and I've read takes now from every 
05:23.580: different corner of the internet about 
05:24.960: what it was and what took place you have 
05:26.639: people speculating that this is all 
05:28.020: staged do not believe that do 
05:30.060: believe that it was an Insurrection or 
05:32.580: Mutiny by progosian think the trigger 
05:34.320: for it was the fact that his Wagner 
05:37.500: organization was being merged in with 
05:40.500: the ministry of defense and the regular 
05:42.180: Russian army and his men were all being 
05:43.919: made to sign contracts with the ministry 
05:46.680: defense that would have resulted in 
05:49.259: giant loss of income and status for 
05:51.479: pregosian simultaneously for months now 
05:53.940: he's been criticizing the ministry of 
05:56.340: Defense specifically the the minister of 
05:58.320: defense shoigu and the 
06:00.539: Chief general of the general staff 
06:03.380: gerasimov so he's been vocally critical 
06:06.240: them and think that this basically 
06:08.880: erupted into mutiny by him where he 
06:13.080: basically tried to leverage his position 
06:15.360: like you said he marched what they now 
06:18.900: think are about 000 men which is about 
06:20.880: quarter of Wagner into rostov on Don 
06:24.180: then took the ministry headquarters 
06:26.039: and sent about three thousand of his men 
06:28.139: convoy to Moscow think that 
06:31.080: although this is probably best described 
06:33.000: mutiny think that it did have 
06:35.880: coup optionality to it think that 
06:38.580: pagosian was seeking to find out how 
06:42.240: much support Putin had and who might 
06:44.280: join him and he had put out number of 
06:46.440: statements that think from the Russian 
06:48.539: regime's point of view could be 
06:49.680: described as seditious 
06:51.600: that morning and he there's lot of 
06:54.120: evidence that he staged this attack on 
06:56.220: his base he claimed that there was 
06:58.560: missile attack by the ministry of 
06:59.759: defense and that's what launched this 
07:01.259: March for justice and in his comments 
07:04.680: was careful not to criticize Putin 
07:07.080: directly but he had lot to say about 
07:08.520: Ministry defense and the overall conduct 
07:10.740: the war and it was think harshly 
07:12.720: critical 
07:13.740: indirectly of of Putin and think he 
07:16.139: was looking to see who might support him 
07:18.539: and what happened is that on the way to 
07:21.060: Moscow during this Convoy nobody 
07:24.120: supported him in fact all the statements 
07:26.520: came out from the other generals 
07:28.740: including sir vegan including all the 
07:31.139: regional governors 
07:32.759: members of the Duma and other 
07:35.880: important figures in Russian society and 
07:37.800: there wasn't single person willing to 
07:39.419: publicly support for Goshen and that's 
07:41.880: when Putin went on TV called this 
07:43.919: basically an act of treason and stab 
07:45.660: the back and at that point think 
07:48.000: progressions options were pretty limited 
07:49.979: and he basically took deal 
07:52.560: that was brokered by lukashenko in which 
07:54.539: would go into Exile in Belarus in 
07:58.919: exchange for basically being allowed to 
08:00.539: live that was basically the deal that 
08:02.880: was ultimately cut and so think where 
08:04.800: things stand today is that although 
08:07.680: think this was an embarrassment and 
08:09.479: black eye for the Russian regime it 
08:11.819: never looks good for regime to have any 
08:15.060: kind of mutiny or insurrection 
08:17.699: and think that it does raise questions 
08:20.460: that poon's now gonna have to answer to 
08:22.800: his various allies and supporters about 
08:24.599: how stable his regime is think 
08:26.460: ultimately Putin has ended up in place 
08:29.639: consolidating Russian Society behind 
08:32.520: him like said there were no power 
08:34.140: centers that supported this Mutiny they 
08:37.620: all rallied to Putin's defense and the 
08:39.360: people of Russia even though Ferguson is 
08:41.700: popular figure being kind of war 
08:43.560: hero from the Battle of bakmut the the 
08:46.020: Russian Society supported Putin think 
08:48.000: he's at something like 80 percent poll 
08:50.160: numbers so think where are things 
08:53.399: well like Lovato Center which is an 
08:55.620: independent polling Agency for example 
08:58.080: these are not the Russian regime's own 
09:00.180: numbers would you say in poll that you 
09:02.880: don't support Putin 
09:04.399: well don't know how levada Center what 
09:07.320: their methodology is but these numbers 
09:09.540: when the numbers are bad are cited by 
09:11.640: Western sources but there are other 
09:13.320: forms of evidence too you may have seen 
09:15.120: this video that went viral over the past 
09:16.920: few days of this song that's now the 
09:19.980: number one chart Buster in in Russia 
09:23.100: where it's this very patriotic Russian 
09:25.500: song where they're basically singing 
09:27.959: Russian that's sort of the main 
09:29.160: chorus Nick can you pull up the song I'd 
09:31.200: like to see this please coming at you 
09:33.420: 95.5 love Russia oh my God this is 
09:37.740: some serious propaganda 
09:40.620: wow yeah 
09:42.890: [Music] 
09:45.720: yeah mean that looks like pretty 
09:47.220: good party 
09:50.640: you look up the the lyrics to the 
09:53.220: song the English translation of the 
09:55.260: lyrics the gist of it is I'm basically 
09:57.360: proud to be Russian and don't care 
09:59.220: who doesn't like it that's basically the 
10:02.160: the lyrics of it how do you get invited 
10:04.019: that party 
10:06.260: got so many jokes I'm not gonna make 
10:08.580: them know you gotta be careful be 
10:10.440: careful here folks you gotta be careful 
10:12.480: here why it looks like fun party it's 
10:14.399: catchy song 
10:15.959: mean love to dress up and show up 
10:18.420: tell me where to show up Putin think 
10:20.220: the point here is that Russian Society 
10:22.500: United behind the state and wanting 
10:25.860: fight this war and think that part 
10:28.019: the reason why Ferguson's Mutiny was 
10:30.720: oversold as an imminent coup that 
10:33.720: would bring about the collapse of the 
10:35.760: Putin regime and of the Russian war 
10:37.680: effort and of their front line is 
10:39.959: because at least since the beginning of 
10:41.339: this war we've had this narrative that 
10:43.620: we applied enough pressure to Russia 
10:46.019: that there'd be palace Intrigue and 
10:48.839: palace coup and that liberal forces 
10:51.420: inside of Russia would rise up and 
10:53.279: topple the dictator Putin and basically 
10:55.380: get them out of this war and think 
10:57.180: what's happened is fairly predictable 
10:59.459: but it's the opposite of that which is 
11:01.019: the Russian people are rallying around 
11:02.940: the flag and rallying around Putin the 
11:04.860: war leader and they are patriotic 
11:07.500: people just like the ukrainians and 
11:09.839: think both these countries that both the 
11:11.640: Russians and the ukrainians are proud 
11:13.440: people and think they're in fight to 
11:15.540: the death and think that both 
11:17.220: countries okay regardless as existential 
11:19.920: and we have basically stuck ourselves in 
11:22.079: the middle of this fight to the death 
11:23.579: between these two countries and don't 
11:25.260: see this working out very well okay so 
11:27.240: look will make an admission 
11:29.579: consider myself modestly well-read 
11:32.040: person modestly well-informed had 
11:35.519: never heard of the Wagner group or 
11:37.200: pregosian prior to this coup attempt 
11:39.959: last week Jay Cal had you guys heard of 
11:42.839: this person before 
11:44.640: and the Wagner group yeah yeah 
11:48.000: well maybe I'm an idiot or I'm just 
11:50.160: not interested think what was so 
11:51.899: surprising was like how out of the blue 
11:53.459: the story seemed to be last week that 
11:56.100: there was this disagreement between this 
11:58.200: person that commanded this paramilitary 
12:00.000: organization who then turned around 
12:02.160: against Putin and stood up against him 
12:04.200: and marched back towards Moscow and it 
12:06.839: felt to me like it came little bit out 
12:09.180: the blue and was such like weird 
12:11.220: kind of shocking event did it feel kind 
12:13.440: like that to you guys that there was 
12:16.440: surprising instability and the 
12:18.120: surprising potential Revolution 
12:20.220: happening locally think stepping back 
12:22.260: here and just looking at the news cycle 
12:24.480: obviously it don't think many people 
12:26.579: expected this this was wild card and 
12:29.040: people could be humble in you know 
12:31.500: their belief of like how much they 
12:33.540: actually understand about what's going 
12:34.740: there 
12:35.880: the Russian soldiers are not in favor of 
12:37.800: this war this is war that's very 
12:39.480: unpopular in Russia actually and for the 
12:42.120: Ukraine having been invaded by Russia 
12:44.100: they're fighting for their land and 
12:45.180: they're gonna they are much more 
12:46.620: motivated wouldn't believe any of this 
12:48.480: propaganda but this is bit of raw 
12:50.160: shock test everybody on the left got on 
12:51.959: Twitter and said this is the end of 
12:53.519: Putin everybody's gonna rise up in the 
12:55.620: streets and they overplayed that you 
12:57.600: know angle of the story and then of 
12:59.100: course the right or people who are 
13:01.160: pro-russian or anti the West backing 
13:04.560: this war are going to take the other 
13:05.579: side Freeburg they're going to take the 
13:06.839: side of 
13:08.339: you know oh everybody loves Russia 80 of 
13:11.459: people are voting for this it's 
13:12.959: ridiculous to think that anybody in 
13:14.160: Russia is going to answer 
13:15.540: you like Putin do you support Putin 
13:17.579: survey can you imagine Putin's 
13:20.100: murderous dictator who kills all of his 
13:22.500: enemies and he controls through violence 
13:24.660: nobody's answering survey correctly 
13:26.760: this you know top song is complete 
13:29.639: propaganda Putin has control of the 
13:31.920: entire media apparatus there 
13:33.959: with this showed actually if you step 
13:36.120: back and you look at you go to the party 
13:37.680: though if you were invited well mean 
13:39.480: are there going to be potential LPS 
13:40.740: there 
13:42.120: last week 
13:44.180: it's just joke folks but stepping back 
13:47.100: you look at modern day dictators they 
13:49.620: tend to stay in power for about three 
13:50.880: decades Putin's in his third 
13:53.399: and uh think we're gonna see in uh the 
13:57.420: next 10 years 
13:58.680: Putin lose power and he's going to be 
14:02.220: out of power 
14:03.660: and when we look back on it it's going 
14:05.639: be one of two causes it's going to be 
14:07.079: either cancer which you know the 
14:08.639: speculation is has had cancer and that's 
14:10.440: why he disappears from View 
14:12.660: because he might be getting treatment 
14:14.760: and we'll look back on us that the end 
14:17.579: his power will be and his control of 
14:21.899: Russia which he controlling these 
14:24.800: controlling through violence and fear of 
14:27.360: violence the threat of violence is 
14:28.680: exhausting you have to be paranoid and 
14:30.360: that's why it generally doesn't last 
14:31.440: that long especially compared to the 
14:33.240: west where we have democracy and 
14:34.620: people last about half decade 
14:37.320: will will look back on his end which 
14:39.839: will be in the next 10 years either 
14:41.760: through cancer or through his invasion 
14:44.579: Ukraine this is the biggest blunder 
14:46.440: he's ever made and and this is really 
14:49.440: crazy sign that somebody would actually 
14:52.320: attempt or even float coup is insane 
14:56.399: he's murdered every single person who 
14:58.680: has ever even 
15:00.199: challenges Authority in minor way the 
15:03.240: fact that his one of his right hand men 
15:05.519: this is one of his tight Inner Circle 
15:08.699: the fact that one of the people in his 
15:10.320: tight Inner Circle would actually start 
15:13.740: heading towards Moscow is insane so to 
15:17.100: say this wasn't big deal and Putin's 
15:19.620: you know now Consolidated power and 
15:21.120: everybody's in the street dancing 
15:24.540: this is just simply not true never 
15:27.240: said it wasn't big deal wasn't 
15:28.560: talking about you was talking about 
15:29.519: the mids on Twitter never mentioned 
15:31.019: your name think that um your point 
15:34.260: Cal at the beginning that this doesn't 
15:36.540: really seem to change anyone's point of 
15:38.279: view on the Outlook your point of view 
15:39.660: sounds like it's the same as it was 
15:41.519: week ago sacked your point of view is 
15:43.800: probably the same as it was week ago 
15:45.959: think there are couple of takeaways 
15:47.160: here first of all 
15:48.779: they've had polling of opinion in Russia 
15:51.300: for long time and like said when the 
15:53.820: polls go the way that the Western 
15:55.620: sources want no one questions their 
15:58.139: accuracy again don't know exactly the 
16:00.240: methodology but levada Center is an 
16:02.279: independent pollster that Western 
16:04.199: Publications do trust hear them repeat 
16:07.019: over and over again and you know by 
16:10.500: their methodology which assume hasn't 
16:12.120: changed think Putin's popularity 
16:13.500: before the war is around 65 percent now 
16:16.019: they're showing it at about 83 percent 
16:17.519: Jason you may not like the war and you 
16:20.940: know certainly don't like them nobody 
16:23.160: likes the war but think it is simply 
16:25.320: fact that the Russian people have 
16:27.779: rallied around the flag and they do 
16:29.699: support this war and and Putin as the 
16:33.000: leader now do think he has egg on his 
16:36.300: face here from this pagosian Uprising in 
16:38.160: terms of did see this coming no 
16:39.959: didn't have this on my bingo card 
16:41.279: don't think anybody else did either 
16:42.240: however did know who provision is 
16:44.279: certainly mean I've been tracking 
16:45.600: progosian statements 
16:47.399: since around February he's been vocally 
16:49.860: criticizing the ministry of Defense 
16:51.660: specifically shoigu and jarasimov in 
16:54.660: increasingly insubordinate and you could 
16:56.519: argue even seditious ways I'm really 
16:59.579: kind of surprised in way that he 
17:01.079: wasn't dealt with before this and I'm 
17:03.180: sure that the Kremlin is kicking itself 
17:04.980: for probably not dealing with it sooner 
17:07.199: but in terms of why he stole alive 
17:10.140: think that Putin had really tough 
17:11.939: decision to make about you quash this 
17:14.520: Rebellion completely which would have 
17:17.520: led to horrific images of you know 
17:20.220: violence potentially in Moscow or 
17:22.140: Russians and Russians killing Russians 
17:25.020: that might have actually led the the 
17:27.179: Russian front to question itself or 
17:29.220: collapse so think he did the expedient 
17:31.679: thing which is he cut deal he got 
17:33.480: lukashenko to help broker and he cut 
17:35.220: deal and think at the end of the day 
17:37.799: think that he made the cool-headed 
17:39.720: decision that was in his and in Russian 
17:43.559: interest which was to avoid this to 
17:45.840: getting to the point of bloody 
17:47.539: Insurrection okay any um any point of 
17:51.120: view shift for you coming out of the 
17:53.820: pregosian event of the last week on 
17:56.160: Russia Ukraine mean want to know how 
17:59.100: much he got paid 
18:00.480: stop marching towards Moscow yeah 
18:03.480: mean it is like mean it must have been 
18:05.220: must have been lot 
18:08.760: not bad for guy that was what Putin's 
18:11.340: caterer few years ago right he started 
18:13.740: catering business spent nine years 
18:15.720: jail this guy's life been nine years 
18:17.400: jail it's like The Sopranos he went 
18:19.559: jail for nine years for selling 
18:20.700: illegal hot dogs or something and all of 
18:22.380: sudden mean got just paid billions 
18:25.620: dollars to basically stop his 
18:27.900: paramilitary group from taking over one 
18:29.820: the largest countries in the world 
18:30.840: it's the largest mean nuclear Arsenal 
18:32.520: the world yeah 
18:33.919: just so you know who this guy is mean 
18:36.240: he really is the street Thug that 
18:39.360: Putin is always accused of being 
18:41.580: was street dog he did go to jail 
18:44.340: was one of these guys who came up 
18:47.039: Russia as businessman when to be 
18:49.980: businessman you had to be so tough 
18:51.660: businessmen were getting murdered left 
18:52.980: and right by gangsters you almost had to 
18:54.960: gangster yourself apparently he 
18:57.240: made some money in the supermarket chain 
18:59.460: business and that led him to create 
19:01.740: catering business which brought him to 
19:03.360: Putin's attention and he started 
19:05.100: catering for the Kremlin he's sometimes 
19:07.500: called Putin's Chef don't think he was 
19:09.179: chef himself he was the guy who owned 
19:11.580: owned the business and then from 
19:13.799: there he was given the license to create 
19:15.600: this PMC this private uh military 
19:17.700: corporation 
19:19.380: Bogner group he wasn't the only founder 
19:21.660: it he had co-founder who was 
19:23.340: actually the military man behind it but 
19:25.919: Wagner became this this group of 
19:28.500: mercenaries who do all sorts of business 
19:30.620: Africa mainly where they are working 
19:33.600: behalf of governments there 
19:36.360: protect mineral resources or oil 
19:38.700: wells all sorts of things Sopranos 
19:41.160: Captain who would he be like Phil 
19:42.299: leotardo just like 20 years in jail 
19:44.340: comes out think it's sort of like John 
19:46.140: Gotti going against Michael Corleone 
19:47.940: yeah think that Putin is sort of the 
19:50.520: very cold right rational guy with 
19:53.340: everything in his head who's very 
19:54.900: calculated it doesn't reveal much right 
19:57.600: more like Michael Corleone whereas 
19:59.520: think that is emotional erratic he's 
20:03.539: been saying these statements for months 
20:04.919: here which don't see how they lose 
20:06.120: constantly Loose Cannon and the crazy 
20:08.340: thing though is is that what you saw on 
20:10.740: Twitter and social media was 
20:12.840: unrestrained Glee really delirium over 
20:16.080: the idea that pagosian my topple Putin 
20:18.840: and become the custodian of Russia's 
20:21.539: thousands of nuclear weapons yeah and 
20:23.580: you know so my comment on this whole 
20:25.380: thing is be careful what you wish for 
20:27.299: why in the world would Americans want 
20:30.720: that we'd be jumping out of the frying 
20:32.280: pan Into the Fire you know I've been 
20:33.720: saying since the beginning of the war 
20:34.799: that this fantasy that Putin is going to 
20:36.840: toppled by palace goo and you're 
20:38.520: getting replacement with navalny or 
20:39.960: something like that we're going to get 
20:41.340: Gorbachev 2.0 said that was always 
20:43.620: unrealistic and what you're much more 
20:45.240: likely to end up with is an even worse 
20:47.660: dictator or possible or hardliner and 
20:51.299: think that is what would happen if 
20:52.919: Ferguson had taken over think would 
20:54.179: have been much worse for the West the 
20:55.799: final point is what's the takeaway from 
20:57.480: here is think this is going to put 
20:59.280: more pressure on Putin to conduct the 
21:02.160: war in more violent way know that 
21:05.100: people already think that the war is 
21:06.900: horrible and violent but Putin has been 
21:08.940: criticized by hardliners on his right 
21:11.820: for basically making the war special 
21:13.980: military operation instead of an all-out 
21:15.840: war and progosian think expected to 
21:18.600: find more support among the sort of 
21:21.240: ultra nationalists in Russia and among 
21:23.100: the military who have been critical of 
21:25.500: Putin for waging the war in what they 
21:27.960: consider to be too half-hearted or an 
21:30.299: incomplete way they would like to see 
21:32.039: this declared to be war they would 
21:33.600: like to see the full mobilization of 
21:35.820: Russian society and this is the problem 
21:38.100: that see now is that think Putin 
21:40.020: already knew but this has to underscore 
21:42.960: for him that this war is existential for 
21:44.820: him personally if he loses it's the end 
21:47.039: not only his regime but probably his 
21:49.140: life in Russia and think he's going to 
21:51.240: whatever it takes to win this war and 
21:53.640: think you could see now over the next 
21:55.020: few months full mobilization in Russia 
21:57.360: and think that this could lead us to 
21:59.460: the next point of escalation in this war 
22:01.200: that is if this Ukrainian 
22:02.940: counteroffensive actually is successful 
22:04.440: some level right now it is it is not 
22:06.600: succeeding so there's no reason there's 
22:08.220: reason for Putin to do that but if if 
22:10.740: this counter offensive succeeds you will 
22:12.480: see the next level of escalation the 
22:13.980: fact you did great job stringing six 
22:15.659: points together think my key takeaway 
22:17.700: which is now 18 points you've made so 
22:21.240: you can retire for the rest of the show 
22:22.799: key takeaway from your series of 
22:25.080: statements however 
22:26.520: an important one which is to watch 
22:28.020: the potential escalation driven by Putin 
22:30.600: here 
22:31.860: any wrap up otherwise I'm going to move 
22:33.480: forward 
22:34.280: you know go ahead thinking about this 
22:36.659: like 
22:37.679: there's famous Sun Tzu quote the 
22:39.960: Supreme Art of War is to subdue the 
22:41.520: enemy without fighting 
22:43.440: this is big mistake and we need to 
22:46.679: make sure that we don't get into war 
22:48.960: with Taiwan and China and China over 
22:51.120: Taiwan so okay we have to avoid these 
22:53.280: things and then that's what and are in 
22:55.020: alignment Sun Tzu calacanus we heard it 
22:57.900: here first let's uh move forward with 
23:00.059: peace can only hope that the conflict 
23:01.919: ends soon as I've always said realized 
23:05.039: over the last week how little know 
23:06.480: about the Russian military conflict with 
23:09.419: Ukraine and appreciate 
23:12.120: Sexes contributions super helpful went 
23:15.539: Cal UC Berkeley 
23:18.179: 1997 fall in 97 and it was the last year 
23:22.799: that Cal had affirmative action 
23:24.840: Admissions and remember at that time 
23:27.480: there was big case guy named Baki 
23:30.179: was rejected by the University of 
23:31.679: California Davis Medical School and he 
23:33.720: alleged reverse discrimination in 1974 
23:36.059: and sued the University of California 
23:39.299: and eventually it became landmark U.S 
23:41.340: Supreme Court case Regents of the 
23:43.140: University of California versus Baki and 
23:45.360: 1995 the UC Regents voted to 
23:48.360: eliminate affirmative action 
23:50.100: the year that was at Cal think 
23:52.799: was the last year of affirmative action 
23:54.799: Admissions and it's obviously been 
23:57.000: pretty hot topic 
24:00.000: here in California 
24:03.299: for the past you know 25 uh 30 years 
24:06.059: this morning the Supreme Court ruled on 
24:08.760: two separate cases regarding using race 
24:12.320: an admissions criteria in college 
24:15.240: admissions and the votes were six to 
24:17.580: three against affirmative action in the 
24:19.559: University of North Carolina case in six 
24:21.179: two against affirmative action in the 
24:23.400: Harvard case 
24:24.600: katanji Brown Jackson recused herself 
24:26.700: because she previously served on 
24:28.020: Harvard's Board of overseers all the 
24:30.600: conservative as their you know kind of 
24:32.220: characterized judges voted to strike 
24:34.380: down affirmative action and all the as 
24:36.240: their characterized liberal judges voted 
24:38.460: keep it both of these cases were 
24:40.080: filed in 2014 by group called students 
24:42.179: for fair admissions 
24:43.919: and effectively the court said that at 
24:47.220: Harvard at UNC the schools were 
24:49.799: systematically discriminating against 
24:51.360: Asian Americans in violation of civil 
24:53.220: rights laws by using uh their race as 
24:56.460: system for for profiling excluding 
24:59.580: and trying to be more inclusive of 
25:01.500: more diverse and racially diverse 
25:04.380: set of applicants so tomorrow I'd love 
25:07.260: your read guess on the surprise or 
25:10.799: this was an accept expected case think 
25:13.620: Saxon mentioned this before but 
25:15.600: think we both expected this to happen 
25:18.840: think it's probably important to maybe 
25:22.860: set up more practical explainer 
25:26.220: Friedberg so Nick if you want to just 
25:28.020: throw up that 
25:29.940: image that just sent you we can sort 
25:32.340: explain the Genesis of the lawsuit so 
25:36.539: what you can see here 
25:39.059: admit rates into Harvard 
25:42.539: race 
25:44.100: ethnicity but also by academic decile 
25:47.039: yeah and so what it basically shows in 
25:49.860: nutshell is an African-American student 
25:52.080: the 40th percentile of the academic 
25:55.440: index is actually more likely to get in 
25:58.320: than an Asian student at the 100th 
26:00.900: percentile 
26:02.100: and so that at the core is sort of sorry 
26:04.559: that means that means that the Asian 
26:07.140: American student had better scores than 
26:11.360: other applicants and still didn't get 
26:15.120: right right 
26:18.240: you have to go back think to 2003 
26:23.039: when essentially what the Supreme Court 
26:25.740: said is like look we're going to allow 
26:27.480: this affirmative action stuff to last 
26:29.640: roughly for another 25 years 
26:32.220: but by that point we expect that the 
26:35.100: work that needed to be done will have 
26:36.720: been done again this is them saying this 
26:39.000: not me 
26:40.980: and so think what today does is 
26:43.860: actually 
26:44.940: quite important not just for what it 
26:47.640: means for universities 
26:49.679: but also what it means for private 
26:51.480: Enterprises so just to take second on 
26:53.279: this think what happens today 
26:56.400: the pretty obvious stuff which is 
26:58.980: that you have to change University 
27:00.779: applications you have to change all of 
27:03.779: the admissions profiling all of the 
27:05.400: stuff that you would normally do 
27:08.039: you probably I'm not even sure if you 
27:09.779: can even have box where you can 
27:11.220: declare race maybe you can or cannot 
27:13.380: don't even know 
27:14.640: but all of that changes today 
27:16.620: then the question is well what's the 
27:18.299: first order derivative what changes next 
27:20.940: and called someone who's pretty well 
27:23.340: known 
27:24.600: constitutional supreme court lawyer on 
27:26.820: this and 
27:28.380: The Next Step 
27:30.240: probably going to be around Athletics 
27:33.120: based and legacy-based admissions 
27:35.820: Athletics based admissions are pretty 
27:37.620: obvious which is you don't really have 
27:39.720: great grades 
27:41.460: but you're really stupendous at sport 
27:44.340: that's important to that school 
27:46.380: then they let you in because they 
27:48.539: want to compete inside sport for 
27:50.159: whatever reason 
27:51.480: the Legacy one is even more prickly 
27:53.220: which is not you're kind of dummy but 
27:55.679: your parents are rich and or went to the 
27:57.600: school before 
27:58.860: and so then they let you in as well 
28:01.559: and 
28:03.840: his thought on this is that those things 
28:07.080: will go away because if you can't use 
28:10.440: race-based admissions to kind of balance 
28:13.020: the scales then it'll become pretty 
28:16.260: quick where somebody launches 
28:17.940: legacy-based lawsuit or an athletic 
28:20.520: based bias lawsuit and wins that as well 
28:23.940: that's the first order derivative so 
28:26.100: you know the thought are those because 
28:27.900: those aren't constitutionally 
28:31.020: protected whereas equality based on race 
28:35.220: but it becomes huge headache for these 
28:36.960: schools 
28:37.919: right and so you're going to be fighting 
28:39.779: these admission standards constantly 
28:42.419: changing and so if you're not going to 
28:44.520: let you know 
28:45.900: bunch of poor minority black and brown 
28:48.299: kids in but you're letting in the Sons 
28:51.840: and Daughters of Rich important people 
28:55.020: think that that's going to paint that 
28:56.520: school in very bad light so think 
28:58.740: that's so important white typically 
29:01.260: white typically white although one would 
29:03.539: say the great thing over the last couple 
29:06.120: decades is there have been lot of 
29:07.860: minorities that have gotten into these 
29:09.360: very elite schools which means this 
29:12.179: their kids would be the first generation 
29:14.100: that's eligible for legacy but you're 
29:15.840: gonna wipe that away so think from 
29:18.899: just social stigma perspective and 
29:21.240: have solution for this which I'll get 
29:22.620: at the end for those people but so 
29:24.659: think that's the first order derivative 
29:25.919: the second order derivative is now what 
29:27.960: lawsuits get launched and what are the 
29:29.580: implications for private companies right 
29:31.919: right now this affects any 
29:34.080: institution that receives Federal 
29:35.520: funding and that includes all the 
29:37.620: universities so there's no private or 
29:39.179: public university really except for 
29:40.799: handful that don't take this money so 
29:42.419: they'll all have to do this 
29:44.220: but the really important question after 
29:46.080: that will be what happens to companies 
29:48.419: like apple or Facebook or Exxon who have 
29:52.460: race-based programs to try to attract 
29:56.299: African-American Engineers or 
29:59.220: Hispanic 
30:01.080: chemists whatever whatever the program 
30:02.760: that you want to come up with 
30:05.039: will those get challenged and will those 
30:07.679: companies have to change and my friends 
30:10.080: thoughts on that were that yes that 
30:11.940: those would also change and that's going 
30:14.220: have really important impact on 
30:16.020: private Enterprise and how they approach 
30:17.760: this stuff and how Dei stuff works and 
30:20.399: frankly Downstream how ESG works because 
30:23.100: all these ESG check boxes now some of 
30:25.140: them will actually become illegal right 
30:27.740: think the importance of decision 
30:30.720: can't be really understated it's going 
30:32.820: the changes will be slow and then 
30:36.000: they'll be fast they'll first touch 
30:38.100: higher ed but then think they'll touch 
30:39.600: private Enterprise and so think it was 
30:41.279: it was very important 
30:44.159: decision in America that just happened 
30:46.740: what is 
30:48.600: what is the right ethics and and values 
30:51.659: mean what do you guys guess we could 
30:53.399: just do this around the table Jacob 
30:54.840: maybe you kick it off 
30:56.700: should we mean from your point of view 
30:58.980: you think that values should include 
31:02.840: racial diversity in Admissions and 
31:06.059: universities yeah this is like the 
31:08.220: ultimate or is the values about equality 
31:10.919: opportunity for everyone regardless 
31:12.840: race right you're asking the exact 
31:14.580: right question think that's the 
31:17.399: world's greatest moderator but yeah 
31:18.840: doing solid job so far and this 
31:20.760: creates lot of cognitive dissonance 
31:22.080: for people right because you you really 
31:24.120: want to 
31:25.980: believe that the world is meritocracy 
31:28.200: and uh you know if you were to take 
31:30.600: other 
31:31.740: Pursuits in the world you'd never say 
31:33.299: like we should let race gender 
31:36.480: age affect people's performance in the 
31:39.600: 100 yard dash or their their 
31:41.580: compensation at company right all of 
31:43.799: that should be based on achievement 
31:46.260: and so there is question on what 
31:48.500: achievements should be taken into 
31:50.399: account when you apply to school 
31:52.860: and it's pretty obvious the Legacy thing 
31:55.620: you know is 
31:57.000: you know back door into these schools 
31:59.520: but we want to feel like we're also 
32:02.399: making progress because listen the world 
32:04.500: has been unfair 
32:06.120: the world was built on slavery and our 
32:10.200: country has you know it's only 150 years 
32:12.840: past that and Civil Rights Act was what 
32:15.419: 1964 or 65 like we've we've we really 
32:18.720: want to see everybody achieve here so 
32:20.700: think you have to pause for second and 
32:21.899: say well if the goal is you want to see 
32:25.440: you know black Americans perform better 
32:27.840: and think that's the the underlying 
32:31.919: concern here 
32:33.360: and it is based on the legacy of America 
32:35.840: well how do you do that and think 
32:38.340: we're looking way too far down in the 
32:41.460: educational pipeline 
32:43.320: the solution here is really Child Care 
32:45.179: the solution here is Nursery schools 
32:46.799: pre-k 
32:47.880: elementary school education and those 
32:49.919: things need competition and that's where 
32:51.600: people fall behind to be looking at this 
32:53.640: the end of the academic journey is 
32:56.460: think crazy so you know when I'm 
32:58.919: president I'm going to have 365 day 
33:02.039: year you know child care and 
33:05.159: Pre-K and that's where we should if we 
33:07.620: really want to try to make up for some 
33:09.360: wrongs in the history of this country 
33:11.039: and try to have better outcomes we need 
33:13.559: competition in schools 
33:15.299: which means probably breaking some of 
33:16.799: these unions and giving people vouchers 
33:18.480: and choice and then we have to invest 
33:20.700: more in the earliest stages of Education 
33:23.880: and think everybody wants to see 
33:26.880: better system here Dei to chamat's point 
33:30.960: is illegal to hire people based on 
33:33.360: race gender any of those criteria 
33:35.159: obviously and the Dai programs are 
33:38.640: trying to fill more applicants so their 
33:41.760: goal typically in the way they don't 
33:43.380: break the law is to just try to in their 
33:46.919: best cases find more applicants and but 
33:51.360: even that does feel like there's many 
33:54.240: times in life when 
33:56.460: um people will say things in Corporate 
33:58.559: America like we have too many white guys 
34:00.539: this these positions we need we 
34:02.700: cannot hire another white guy so the 
34:04.799: reality of Dei that I've seen up close 
34:06.600: and personal when was at AOL I've told 
34:08.220: the story before 
34:09.720: somebody said to me there's no way for 
34:11.879: to make you an EVP you have to stay 
34:14.159: SVP and said why is that like I'm 
34:16.080: doing all this EVP level work and they 
34:17.580: said because you're white guy 
34:19.080: and the entire company is white guys at 
34:21.899: EVP and we cannot add another white guy 
34:24.659: there but we'll just give you the same 
34:25.740: bonus compensation so don't worry about 
34:28.320: and so there's all kinds of games being 
34:29.820: played here but think it's great that 
34:31.080: we're having this conversation right 
34:32.220: it's hard conversation for America to 
34:33.960: have for me the 
34:36.179: I've talked about this in the past I've 
34:38.399: always had 
34:40.080: concern 
34:41.580: when we make the shift away from 
34:44.460: equality of opportunity to quality of 
34:46.619: outcome 
34:47.520: because we all have this objective that 
34:49.679: want to see everyone have equal 
34:52.020: rights to success in some way in the 
34:55.020: United States the question is at what 
34:57.300: point do you move Beyond opportunity 
34:59.820: where everyone is given an equal 
35:01.980: opportunity in this country 
35:05.520: invest themselves in transforming their 
35:07.980: own lives versus 
35:10.680: quality of outcome where regardless of 
35:13.260: how much you do how much effort or 
35:17.040: your trials you were given the same as 
35:19.560: everyone else and that ends up looking 
35:21.420: lot like socialism and it's very 
35:22.680: concerning because think it limits 
35:24.000: progress and opportunity for everyone 
35:26.160: the real challenge with this particular 
35:28.500: topic is college admissions 
35:31.200: about outcome or is about opportunity 
35:34.380: it's outcome in the sense that you spend 
35:36.420: years going to elementary school and 
35:39.720: high school and working hard to get 
35:41.339: yourself into college 
35:42.960: it's the outcome of all of that 
35:44.880: effort and some people aren't given the 
35:46.680: opportunity to have success during those 
35:49.320: years and you know 
35:52.560: and it is an outcome what do you think 
35:54.599: should do and it's an opportunity 
35:56.099: because it's about going to college 
35:57.300: because without having great College 
35:58.500: cycle you may have more tougher time 
36:00.300: getting into into the workforce so it 
36:02.640: that is why it's hard value question 
36:04.200: for me don't have great answer on 
36:06.300: this 
36:07.020: but I'm just pointing out it's lot 
36:08.520: like the abortion argument where both 
36:11.040: sides have some 
36:14.060: value-oriented point of view that feels 
36:16.920: like it's negating the other person's 
36:18.300: point of view 
36:19.500: but at the end of the day they're both 
36:21.180: coming from either this is an 
36:22.440: opportunity or it's an outcome decision 
36:24.119: and that's what makes it so challenging 
36:25.440: the National Bureau of economic research 
36:27.480: did study in 2019 that they published 
36:31.440: and what they found was that 43 so 
36:35.760: of white students admitted to Harvard 
36:38.460: were athletes 
36:41.220: Legacy students or children of 
36:44.760: faculty and staff or had relative that 
36:48.599: were donors to the school 
36:50.359: wait it's rigged and then they found 
36:53.700: top of that that 75 of those white 
36:56.760: students admitted from those four 
36:58.800: categories would have been rejected if 
37:01.500: they had been treated as normal 
37:02.940: applicant so think for all the people 
37:05.880: that are looking at all the black and 
37:07.320: brown kids that may not get into place 
37:09.240: like Harvard 
37:10.859: you don't look at these other 
37:12.480: categories 
37:13.980: is it's bit of gross Injustice 
37:16.320: quite honestly so think that these 
37:17.880: institutions have to evolve and if 
37:19.680: you're going to be forced to be 
37:21.240: meritocratic then actually be 
37:23.160: meritocratic and by the way actually 
37:25.440: fine with legacies and donors but 
37:28.500: think what should happen is you should 
37:29.640: just publish rate card and you should 
37:31.859: make it hyper transparent and so love 
37:34.440: for the rich guy who's got an idiot 
37:36.780: son or daughter let's just be upfront 
37:38.760: and honest with everybody it costs 50 
37:40.680: million dollars to get into Stanford it 
37:42.960: costs 80 million dollars to get into 
37:44.460: Harvard we all know these numbers so we 
37:46.500: should just publish them you should pay 
37:48.359: the price and be done with it and for 
37:50.160: Harvard and Stanford and Yale and all 
37:52.320: these schools 
37:53.579: having an extra 10 or 20 dummies but an 
37:55.859: extra two or three billion may be 
37:57.359: reasonable trade-off but at least it 
37:58.859: would be transparent and fair right this 
38:01.200: an important free market question as 
38:03.119: well because these are private 
38:04.500: institutions they're privately funded 
38:06.180: not if they take federal dollars or not 
38:08.220: agreed yes but if they take federal 
38:09.720: dollars they're not and then it becomes 
38:11.520: government processing it's government 
38:13.560: influence it's state school all those 
38:15.420: there separate category here just 
38:17.820: like country clubs or any private 
38:20.040: membership club where the members of the 
38:22.560: club get to decide who they want to 
38:24.240: admit to the club and is that 
38:26.640: Un-American and should the Supreme Court 
38:28.800: and should our Constitution have role 
38:30.780: defining how private institutions 
38:33.000: make decisions about who gets it no 
38:34.740: Harvard could absolutely return all the 
38:36.420: federal funding the billions of dollars 
38:37.859: year they get that's totally 
38:39.060: reasonable then they even decide to just 
38:40.560: focus on Legacy admits 
38:43.020: that's totally reasonable it's within 
38:44.760: their rights 
38:45.839: sacks like we got it know that know 
38:48.240: that you used up your quote your 
38:49.500: speaking quota already well yeah 
38:51.359: didn't want to didn't want to butt in 
38:52.680: give him four on my points you get 
38:56.460: four of Jake house minutes go ahead 
38:58.339: yeah two points guess so on the 
39:01.260: Legacy thing agree with jamas that we 
39:03.300: should get rid of it it's not 
39:04.500: meritocratic think that if they did 
39:07.079: publish rate card that would be more 
39:08.520: honest but they would be too embarrassed 
39:10.500: and ashamed to do that but think 
39:12.180: making that argument exposes the 
39:13.920: hypocrisy of it 
39:15.359: I've already told my kids I'm not 
39:16.800: helping them get into college so they're 
39:18.480: going to do it on their own and so look 
39:20.760: think by the way that's the best gift 
39:22.859: you can give kids yeah that that 
39:24.780: perspective sorry go ahead sex so that's 
39:27.119: that's Point number one fully agreed on 
39:28.500: the Legacy thing with respect to the 
39:30.359: decision itself that I'm sorry can 
39:32.760: just clarify that do you believe that 
39:34.440: the Legacy thing should be like in 
39:37.260: federal law mean is that government 
39:38.940: thing or do you think that that's how 
39:40.859: those institutions should behave because 
39:42.900: those are different mean I'm asking 
39:44.339: are you suggesting that the law should 
39:45.720: involved that the government should 
39:46.920: involved don't know if it's legal 
39:48.300: thing because don't know how to 
39:49.380: implement that law but um think it's 
39:51.000: something they should stop doing one way 
39:52.260: another maybe it should be law but 
39:54.000: think it should stop so think that's 
39:55.619: important Legacy thing for privacy for 
39:57.599: private membership so just let me just 
40:00.000: double click on that do you think that 
40:02.040: should extend to private membership 
40:03.180: clubs like country clubs as well that 
40:04.680: they shouldn't be allowed to decide who 
40:06.660: they let in and don't let in what makes 
40:08.579: different that it's Harvard is it 
40:09.900: because it's education versus any other 
40:11.700: private membership because it takes 
40:13.200: Federal funding 
40:17.599: for some person to be able to get into 
40:20.339: school they don't deserve to get into 
40:21.839: just because their parent went there or 
40:24.720: just because their parents wrote check 
40:26.280: that's unreasonable and if they don't 
40:28.500: take Federal funding these schools take 
40:30.180: much Federal funding that they're 
40:31.560: quasi-public institutions even the 
40:33.839: private ones so that's the distinction 
40:35.460: that's the distinction for you just to 
40:36.900: clear yeah and also there is strong 
40:40.040: meritocracy opportunity argument on this 
40:43.740: and think it's why that whole parents 
40:46.020: College admissions Scandal was was such 
40:48.720: big deal is that for lot of people 
40:50.640: this country the ability to have your 
40:53.280: kids Advance themselves by being the 
40:56.099: first to get into college or going to 
40:57.780: college or going to better college 
40:59.040: that is big part of creating 
41:01.260: opportunity in this country so for 
41:02.579: people to try and defraud that think 
41:04.859: create huge backlash so look think 
41:08.099: that the Legacy thing just needs to end 
41:10.440: one way or another don't know exactly 
41:11.940: what the right legal 
41:14.940: implementation is have two questions 
41:17.099: for the panel number one should you be 
41:19.560: able to say by geography Hey listen 
41:21.359: we're Harvard over Stanford we want to 
41:23.640: have representation of people from 
41:25.260: around the world so we're gonna you know 
41:27.359: have the top three students from each 
41:29.640: country or you know or by population 
41:31.680: however you do it 
41:33.480: you know mathematically 
41:35.339: come in so little bit of geography 
41:37.020: because did hear from one of these 
41:38.880: coaches that cost like six figures to 
41:41.640: get your kids into the college they said 
41:43.440: the best thing you can do is like move 
41:44.700: Kentucky 
41:46.440: you know and then Harvard and Stafford 
41:50.400: are looking to get certain number of 
41:51.720: students from each state don't know 
41:52.740: how true that is but they said that's 
41:54.000: like one of the the top ways to do it 
41:55.619: and then well do you remember Jason just 
41:56.940: build on your point don't know if 
41:58.020: you guys remember but few years ago 
41:59.839: the the in fashion thing to do was to 
42:02.880: learn to play squash and remember all 
42:05.339: these parents telling me that and they 
42:07.500: had kids that were older than my kids 
42:08.940: and they were they were hiring full-time 
42:11.700: squash coaches because apparently squash 
42:14.400: was like yeah it was all angle shots 
42:16.320: yeah think like stop with the angle 
42:19.200: shooting guys yes the gun should go off 
42:21.900: you should run the race and your time is 
42:24.480: your time and you should go to whatever 
42:26.220: the best school is that you deserve to 
42:28.079: get into based on your academic ability 
42:29.880: now going back 
42:31.440: the big problem and think Jason you 
42:33.599: really nailed it on the head 
42:35.820: trying to fix it with affirmative action 
42:38.160: the University 
42:39.839: still quite unfair in the sense that 
42:42.300: there are so many black and brown kids 
42:44.280: think with tons of potential that don't 
42:45.960: even get there 
42:47.339: and so the real question is what are you 
42:49.140: doing at the grade school and at the 
42:50.940: high school and at the preschool 
42:53.160: that you actually get more of these 
42:55.200: kids to the starting line because fixing 
42:57.839: when they're 18 think is little 
43:00.000: too late yeah right fixing it for 300 
43:03.060: three four and five years old that's 
43:05.220: when they deserve and need all the help 
43:07.380: the world to yourself that's why we 
43:09.119: need school choice we need Charter 
43:10.680: Schools we need to break the Monopoly 
43:12.480: that the unions have over the schools 
43:14.280: running it running for their own benefit 
43:16.819: you Define institutional racism as 
43:20.160: conditions that trap people on 
43:21.780: conditions of poverty across Generations 
43:23.720: I'd say the abysmal quality of our 
43:26.280: public schools are number one number one 
43:29.579: two and three and the reason is because 
43:30.900: there's no competition and the unions 
43:32.160: run it for their own benefit how long do 
43:34.079: they shut down these schools for in 
43:35.940: California because they didn't want to 
43:37.079: work because they're afraid don't know 
43:38.700: don't see the word we just got label 
43:41.099: enabled 
43:45.180: for the benefit of kids and it wasn't 
43:46.800: even medically necessary that was 
43:48.300: benefit they saw for themselves yeah 
43:49.740: Jacob you come you come from family 
43:51.720: yep that were members of unions because 
43:55.079: they worked for fire for police yeah um 
43:57.960: that right yeah 
44:00.000: speak negatively about the effects of 
44:02.640: the teachers unions on our public 
44:03.960: education system and it think it's 
44:06.420: absolutely correct 
44:08.460: but how do you share the point of view 
44:11.339: from the other side if you're teacher 
44:13.440: and you're member of the union and the 
44:14.880: union takes care of you what's the 
44:17.280: argument yeah sure to say this Union is 
44:20.460: damaging public education and the 
44:22.079: teacher that's working in the union and 
44:23.400: member of the union says this is 
44:25.319: necessary for my livelihood to protect 
44:27.119: for my benefit 
44:29.220: help us share the point of view because 
44:31.560: all have the strongly held point of 
44:33.480: view that the unions are destroying and 
44:34.980: eroding public education 
44:37.099: people have the right 
44:39.240: form unions 
44:41.220: but what we all do is we are forced to 
44:43.440: consumers of one educational product 
44:46.079: because of how we pay taxes we pay taxes 
44:48.240: yeah think in my in California we 
44:50.640: each pay sixteen thousand dollars into 
44:52.319: the educational system and so if you're 
44:54.660: parent you should get that 16k back 
44:56.760: and be able to choose what you do with 
44:58.200: so there's competition so the unions 
45:00.420: can have protection but there still 
45:01.980: should be competition for these services 
45:04.980: and think there are two separate 
45:07.260: issues yeah there's one other thing 
45:09.599: which is 
45:11.400: just want to give shout out to 
45:13.500: non-profit that support called smash 
45:15.720: Academy smash.org it's done by Mitch and 
45:18.900: Freda Kapoor the Mitch Kapoor 
45:22.500: founded Lotus one two three if you're uh 
45:24.780: under the age of 40 you might not know 
45:27.300: and what they do is they realize that 
45:29.579: lot of the students who do get into good 
45:31.020: colleges 
45:32.220: turns out lot of the black and 
45:33.900: brown students they get accepted and 
45:35.520: they're behind in math and so what smash 
45:38.040: has done is they have three-year 
45:39.359: program 
45:40.440: and go speak at it sometimes and 
45:42.359: donate money to it and encourage you 
45:44.040: do the same they have this intensive 
45:46.020: summer program so before you go to 
45:47.700: college tomorrow if you were one of 
45:49.680: those students 
45:51.000: you know you might get into college and 
45:52.859: then they drop out or even worse they 
45:55.260: switch from stem degree to non-stem 
45:58.500: degree because they're two years behind 
46:01.079: stem or year behind on stem and so 
46:03.599: the Kapoor has found this like little 
46:05.359: opportunity to kind of catch people up 
46:07.680: and think that's what we have to do we 
46:09.359: have to address this much earlier and 
46:11.940: not put Band-Aid on it yeah in the 
46:14.040: system the ivy league system 
46:16.680: you know needs to well it's not 
46:19.079: societies right I'm sure it's not just 
46:20.940: pick on Harvard but it's like it's like 
46:22.380: the elite institutions which we talk 
46:24.900: about institutions okay all institutions 
46:26.819: that receive federal funding they need 
46:28.680: take deep look in the mirror and 
46:29.880: say are we doing the best thing for 
46:31.260: society the second question had for 
46:32.700: the panel was well I'm not getting the 
46:34.740: feeling by the way but yeah but our Pure 
46:37.380: academics the best way to accept people 
46:39.900: into college or should there be some 
46:41.700: blend of it like putting Sports aside 
46:43.680: because that's an obvious one but you 
46:45.599: know is there's academics but then 
46:47.160: there's also creativity you know if you 
46:48.420: you might be terrible on your SATs test 
46:51.540: and you might be an incredible virtuoso 
46:53.460: pianist so think what is the criteria 
46:56.339: and making that criteria fair is what we 
46:58.920: all want and it feels tremendously 
47:00.720: unfair my point of view is if the 
47:04.319: government is funding these schools then 
47:06.180: the government certainly has to have 
47:08.400: point of view on what's the reasonable 
47:10.500: model for admissions the government's 
47:13.260: not funding the schools Love 
47:15.660: diversity 
47:16.800: Marketplace love having different 
47:19.500: schools having different admissions 
47:21.060: criteria that allow different people to 
47:24.119: find their path 
47:25.800: through different institutions to your 
47:27.839: point Juilliard does not care perhaps as 
47:30.839: much what you did on you know your sat 
47:34.680: and chemistry 
47:36.800: and art schools do not care as much how 
47:39.780: well you did in math and stem schools 
47:43.079: don't care whether or not you want an 
47:44.940: art competition and think that that's 
47:46.980: the important thing that we need to 
47:48.900: preserve we need to preserve optionality 
47:51.420: for institutions to Define what sorts of 
47:54.599: individuals they want to try and recruit 
47:56.339: and progress and train and get ready for 
47:59.280: the workforce and the path in life that 
48:01.680: they then choose versus trying to create 
48:03.720: cookie cutter model for what the 
48:05.700: government says it's fair for everyone 
48:07.260: and as much as we can take Government 
48:09.300: funding out of these institutions and 
48:11.040: out of these systems and give them the 
48:12.480: freedom to set their own admissions 
48:14.460: criteria and create differential 
48:16.380: Educational Systems think that's going 
48:19.140: create the best diversity of 
48:21.180: Workforce 
48:22.440: and I'm would kind of be more excited 
48:25.140: about that sort of 
48:26.940: Institutional system than one that is 
48:29.520: standardized by the government you know 
48:30.839: why that'll never happen 
48:33.359: because the profit motive of these 
48:35.040: universities is really to be Shadow 
48:37.020: organizations for their endowments 
48:40.319: and the thing with endowments is that 
48:42.780: the people that work there very much 
48:44.760: want to 
48:46.500: get paid and behave like profit 
48:49.380: generating organizations and think 
48:52.440: the issue is that if their sole job was 
48:55.980: really fund 
48:57.540: the 
49:00.240: operational expenses of the University 
49:02.280: then the endowments would be run very 
49:04.319: differently right like take again just 
49:06.420: looked up on the internet but Harvard 
49:08.400: has about 
49:09.540: the operating expenses are roughly 
49:12.480: five and half billion dollars year 
49:14.280: but the revenues are about five and 
49:16.140: half billion dollars year right so if 
49:18.240: instead you had to basically fund you 
49:20.700: know there was essentially no Revenue 
49:22.140: per se right there's there is very 
49:24.000: little tuition and you didn't take any 
49:25.920: federal funding you'd have to come up 
49:27.599: with five billion dollars year so you 
49:29.339: just basically take that as draw 
49:32.400: from your endowment the endowment would 
49:34.920: run very differently it would be 
49:36.839: don't lose money endowment 
49:38.700: that would generate 
49:40.619: very low Vol returns think the problem 
49:43.560: with that is that that's not how the 
49:45.060: endowment at Harvard works 
49:47.280: they wouldn't necessarily make risk 
49:49.680: seeking investments in things like 
49:51.420: private equity and hedge funds and 
49:52.800: Venture Capital into the extent they did 
49:54.359: they would just make much much fewer 
49:55.800: much much smaller or both 
49:57.900: think what you're saying could be 
49:59.880: possible 
50:01.380: but the problem are probably the 
50:03.359: endowments at these universities okay 
50:05.339: well 53 billion dollars moving Harvard's 
50:07.800: endowment now so yeah it would be ten 
50:10.380: percent can anyone tell me who the 
50:11.880: largest real estate owner is in San 
50:13.260: Francisco 
50:14.760: you're not working on the internet oh no 
50:16.859: know know it's that Art Institute 
50:19.079: The Academy of Art University knew 
50:21.000: this because they uh kept buying things 
50:23.339: and using them think she used all the 
50:26.280: profit over the years to buy more real 
50:28.560: estate and she accumulated the largest 
50:30.240: real estate portfolio yeah yeah yeah 
50:32.359: sorry who is she the founder forgot 
50:34.740: her name 
50:35.640: this is for-profit university or 
50:37.920: private or mean non-profit 
50:39.780: University yeah there's lot of artists 
50:41.339: that come out of Academy Art and they 
50:42.540: work in lot of different Industries 
50:44.040: including industrial design including 
50:46.560: animation is what I'm saying is it like 
50:49.380: RISD or is it like actually an art 
50:51.420: school oh no it's great art school 
50:52.980: yeah Academy of Art 
50:55.079: anyway let's keep going so look speaking 
50:57.059: stem 
50:58.440: making big pivot away from art 
51:01.800: AI couple big news items you know 
51:06.119: the AI frenzy continues here in Silicon 
51:09.059: Valley all the way from early to growth 
51:12.420: stage funding through to events we 
51:15.599: saw this week data Brits which is 
51:19.020: privately held data infrastructure 
51:20.640: company announced that they were 
51:21.900: acquiring Mosaic ml for 1.3 billion 
51:24.599: dollars that headline number is based on 
51:27.420: cash and stock purchase price where 
51:30.480: the value of the stock that was being 
51:32.400: used to acquire Mosaic ml 
51:35.099: was based off of the last round's 
51:36.900: valuation for data bricks which was 38 
51:39.660: billion dollars from fundraising that 
51:41.160: they did in 2021 so arguably the 
51:43.380: valuation should be lower and the 
51:44.700: overall purchase price could be 
51:45.900: considered lower but that's besides the 
51:47.940: point Mosaic ml as you guys may remember 
51:50.280: company mentioned number of 
51:52.559: episodes ago 
51:53.940: led by the founder of Nirvana which was 
51:57.180: early AI business that was acquired 
52:00.059: Intel and then he started Mosaic ML 
52:02.700: and he offers 
52:04.740: open source models and shared the 
52:06.480: performance data of their most recent 
52:08.460: announcement on the show 
52:10.140: few weeks ago 
52:12.000: you know there's rumors don't have any 
52:14.640: confirmed reports but there's rumors 
52:16.200: that Mosaic ml saw 
52:18.180: their ARR grow from million to 20 
52:21.420: million dollars since January there was 
52:23.400: other rumors that said they were only at 
52:24.780: million of Revenue regardless 
52:26.760: databricks is paying pretty hefty 
52:28.920: premium and think it begs the question 
52:30.540: what do data infrastructure database 
52:33.059: companies end up looking like in the 
52:35.339: future if AI has to become part of the 
52:37.619: core infrastructure of every Enterprise 
52:39.059: and this is creating big shift so Saks 
52:42.059: our Enterprise 
52:44.339: software 
52:46.260: investor expert maybe you can share with 
52:49.140: what this means for the sector does 
52:50.819: this buoy excitement for AI 
52:53.579: infrastructure startups does this change 
52:56.760: the investing landscape is it just 
52:59.220: reinforcing what folks are already doing 
53:01.920: think it's reinforcement mean the 
53:04.020: space is probably the hottest Spate 
53:05.819: where you're talking about like AI 
53:06.839: infrastructure for Enterprises think 
53:08.880: it's probably the hottest space right 
53:10.200: now in in Venture Land we actually 
53:12.480: looked at this deal we had small 
53:14.099: allocation in our next round they had 
53:16.619: term sheet for series 
53:19.440: emergence was actually an elite it and 
53:21.839: this is Mosaic ml yeah yeah don't know 
53:25.440: I'm supposed to be telling you all 
53:26.400: this but yeah 
53:29.240: it's not great this is why people see it 
53:31.440: breaking news that term sheet from 
53:35.339: emergence to raise 50 million at 400 
53:38.220: posts wow and we yeah and we were gonna 
53:40.859: have small allocation in that and as 
53:43.680: recall 
53:44.760: the valuation was somewhere around 30 to 
53:48.180: times ARR which actually is not that 
53:50.940: insane for very fast scoring company 
53:52.559: hot space so that implies about 10 
53:55.680: million of ARR don't remember the 
53:57.119: exact figure but think that's sort of 
53:58.740: the ballpark but growing very very 
54:00.780: quickly mean up from like one or two 
54:03.240: the beginning of the year right 
54:05.660: actually understand why someone 
54:09.599: would want to acquire or invest in this 
54:11.880: company like said think we wanted to 
54:13.319: invest and while we were sort of you 
54:15.839: know trying our best you didn't say 
54:17.400: anything when talked about him on the 
54:18.599: show few weeks ago you were just 
54:19.740: sitting there mum's word or actually 
54:21.780: knew that this deal was was basically in 
54:23.760: the works because the founder called us 
54:26.099: and he had already promised us 
54:27.780: small allocation around 
54:29.579: Naveen did and he called up and said 
54:31.920: actually I've got this deal so we're 
54:33.420: putting the round on hold and so 
54:36.300: didn't think should say anything 
54:37.380: because obviously it was still ongoing 
54:40.680: but yeah we knew about this deal that 
54:42.540: was kind of coming down the pipe 
54:44.040: didn't know for sure that it would 
54:45.119: happen but but yeah we we heard it was 
54:47.520: the ballpark of this like 1.2 1.3 
54:49.859: billion dollar number which like you 
54:51.660: said because databricks is private 
54:53.280: stock maybe it's only 
54:55.140: or 750 or something like that who 
54:57.960: knows it's still great deal but you 
54:59.640: know lot of people are saying it's 
55:00.540: crazy deal don't think it's crazy 
55:01.619: deal because before this happened after 
55:05.099: Naveen signed the term sheet for the 
55:07.559: series an investor came over the top 
55:10.619: invest at 700 million dollar 
55:12.599: valuation wow so people were kind of 
55:14.700: going crazy now don't think that's 
55:16.440: necessarily rational Behavior think 
55:18.839: that's more of evidence of Mania going 
55:21.240: but think that what he got offered 
55:23.099: obviously fantastic deal and 
55:25.140: think what it's evidence of is that 
55:27.300: these big Enterprise infra companies are 
55:30.300: going to try and build an end-to-end 
55:32.040: tool chain here and think Mosaic ml 
55:35.460: had very very important part of the 
55:38.339: tool set which is training up these 
55:40.619: models basically maximizing GPU 
55:43.040: efficiency because gpus are basically 
55:45.420: the scarce item right now we have GPU 
55:47.940: shortage and it's probably not going to 
55:49.740: get better for year or two if that so 
55:52.500: this is very important part of the of 
55:54.540: the stack and think it's probably 
55:57.000: smart acquisition for both yeah mean 
55:59.520: remember snow snowflake which competes 
56:01.800: with data breaks also acquired Neva 
56:04.020: which was founded by one of my 
56:05.460: colleagues guy work with uh and 
56:07.559: new really great guy sweetheart for 150 
56:10.680: million dollars last month that deal was 
56:12.059: announced and the pattern recognition 
56:15.359: that seems to emerge here is that if 
56:16.920: you're in the data infrastructure 
56:19.260: business it seems like it's becoming 
56:21.720: critical to level up that it's not just 
56:23.400: about storing and moving and 
56:25.680: manipulating data but the interpretation 
56:28.619: data through models and the tooling 
56:31.260: build those models becomes critical 
56:33.300: component think of all of these toolkits 
56:36.059: that these software companies have to 
56:37.380: provide to their by software companies 
56:39.359: and it's big leveling up that's 
56:40.619: necessary which seems to me there's 
56:42.599: other companies out there like them that 
56:44.819: are also going to need to strap on tools 
56:47.819: like this 
56:48.839: make themselves competitive in this 
56:50.700: marketscape which means that there are 
56:52.619: more Acquisitions still to come yeah 
56:54.740: Jacob you guys agree or have different 
56:57.540: point of view looking at it it's it's 
57:00.359: big number the headline number but 
57:02.040: agree with Saks that the actual numbers 
57:03.540: half the number so if it was you know if 
57:05.520: you look at the number of Engineers they 
57:07.079: had based on LinkedIn data and pitchbook 
57:09.599: data probably 60 70 employees 80 
57:12.420: employees and then 40 50 of them are 
57:14.760: Engineers so that puts it at 30 million 
57:16.380: dollars per engineer and that's one way 
57:18.960: look at these acquisitions 
57:21.119: and think you know probably three to 
57:25.559: ten million dollars per engineer for 
57:27.599: like really high-end Engineers is more 
57:29.579: the going price but if this is half that 
57:31.380: amount because they bought it with 
57:33.480: Monopoly money in other words they're 
57:34.920: 2021 price for their company it's great 
57:37.800: and then they get nailed it um Freeburg 
57:39.540: what's happening is 
57:41.460: this layer of uh natural language on top 
57:46.500: any service whether it's something as 
57:49.319: simple as Yelp or something as 
57:50.880: complicated as giant financial company 
57:53.700: with tons of transaction data being able 
57:56.819: talk to it and understand it and then 
57:59.280: have your machine learning team build 
58:02.819: tools so business owners don't have to 
58:05.099: hire data scientists the actual Business 
58:06.780: Leaders can talk to the data and get 
58:09.780: back answers or just say hey tell me 
58:12.119: about our customers how have they 
58:13.500: changed over the year and then hey 
58:15.240: that's pretty interesting tell me more 
58:16.980: about our customers and you know how are 
58:19.920: they reacting to these three new 
58:22.200: products 
58:23.339: and you will get back in intelligence 
58:26.099: that previously was unable 
58:29.240: be accessed and so was uh was 
58:34.559: just at Sequoia yesterday with uh or two 
58:36.839: days ago with the latest seven graduates 
58:38.700: from our accelerator we bring them to 
58:40.380: meet with sax and his team and bring 
58:41.880: them to meet with Sequoia and when we 
58:43.920: were at Sequoia 
58:45.240: realized that of the seven companies 
58:47.880: four of them would not have been 
58:49.859: possible before these machine learning 
58:52.799: apis were available and open AI is but 
58:55.020: one there are now in the companies I'm 
58:57.540: talking to they're they're trialing 
58:59.160: Freeburg on average six seven eight 
59:01.980: language models before they pick one and 
59:03.540: they're not picking open AI every time 
59:05.760: putting that aside these businesses were 
59:07.980: not possible before this technology was 
59:10.500: introduced and available via API in the 
59:12.720: last six to 12 months 
59:14.339: and think there's bunch of 
59:15.900: businesses that economically would not 
59:17.760: work that now work can give one 
59:20.339: example 
59:22.500: there are countless meetings that are 
59:25.260: recorded over uh Zoom right 
59:27.900: think like local school board 
59:30.420: well nobody could ever make database 
59:32.280: all the discussions going on at local 
59:34.799: school boards and then analyze all that 
59:37.380: but now because all of those are saved 
59:40.319: on zoom and they occur on zoom and 
59:42.240: they're available for public record you 
59:44.099: can ingest every single one of those and 
59:46.200: then build Bloomberg terminal of every 
59:48.540: discussion happening at every school 
59:50.040: board everywhere in the United States 
59:52.500: and do that with chat GPT or any of the 
59:56.040: language models and then get really 
59:57.960: great insights from it that would be too 
60:00.359: costly to transcribe at you know 
60:02.880: hundred dollars every hour to 
60:04.619: normalize let alone to analyze and so 
60:07.740: I'm looking at 
60:09.780: businesses as an investor what I'm 
60:12.240: looking at right now is businesses that 
60:13.799: were previously not economically viable 
60:16.680: before this technology and then that are 
60:19.619: now economically viable if that makes 
60:21.240: sense and um I'm just looking at each 
60:23.819: company under that lens right now and 
60:26.280: I'm finding lot of interesting 
60:27.240: startups they seem to have that in 
60:28.440: common similar news supporting this very 
60:32.099: quick Evolution further up the value 
60:34.920: stack so we were just talking about 
60:36.240: these companies that are providing 
60:38.819: effectively tooling as infrastructure 
60:41.940: little bit more up the value stack is 
60:44.819: inflection AI which was started by 
60:46.920: Mustafa Suleiman and Reed Hoffman uh who 
60:50.940: was co-founder while mistafa was 
60:52.619: working with him as 
60:55.200: Venture partner at Greylock but Mustafa 
60:57.780: you guys know was the co-founder of 
61:00.359: deepmind which Google bought for 400 
61:01.859: million dollars really created the core 
61:03.900: Google's AI capability and is 
61:06.359: considered one of the kind of preeminent 
61:08.460: thought leaders and entrepreneurs built 
61:10.559: that has built in this space he started 
61:12.480: inflection 
61:14.220: and the business just announced today 
61:16.200: that they've just closed 1.3 billion 
61:18.000: dollar funding round LED by Microsoft 
61:19.680: Reed Hoffman Bill Gates Eric Schmidt 
61:22.260: Nvidia uh with an intention 
61:25.619: building the largest AI cluster in 
61:27.720: the world 22 000 Nvidia h100s as part of 
61:31.500: the build out but think you've shared 
61:34.020: chamoth historically that these big 
61:36.000: funding rounds for these AI businesses 
61:37.680: that haven't necessarily been launched 
61:39.000: the product yet 
61:40.859: don't make sense is this still you know 
61:43.740: kind of reinforce your point and you 
61:46.319: know what's your read on on the 
61:47.339: inflection funding well the list price 
61:50.220: an h100 is about 30 odd thousand but 
61:53.160: the street price so it's very hard to 
61:55.319: get it so if you go to the if you go to 
61:56.760: like eBay and try to buy an h100 it's 
61:58.680: like 40 or 45 
62:00.359: 000. so if you have 22 000 cluster of 
62:04.140: h100s that's about 900 million dollars 
62:08.099: capex just that 
62:10.559: and then you know all the sundry stuff 
62:12.660: around it call it roughly plus or minus 
62:15.180: billion dollars 
62:17.400: and so of the one and half billion 
62:19.140: they've raised let's say billion goes 
62:21.000: into building this 22 000 node cluster 
62:24.240: you have 500 million for SG and so 
62:27.480: what that leaves behind is basically two 
62:29.220: and half billion of Enterprise value 
62:31.619: for their chatbot 
62:33.900: don't know mean I've never used 
62:35.819: has anybody any of you guys used it 
62:37.920: you guys know if it's good Jason I'm 
62:40.079: sure you've experimented with it have 
62:41.400: you experimented with it or not really 
62:42.720: which one 
62:43.920: pie 
62:45.660: that's what they're that's what their 
62:47.400: chat bot is called pipe yeah think 
62:49.200: it's like api.com or something think 
62:52.020: did try it once 
62:53.880: and it was 
62:55.920: not memorable Oh you mean po no not po 
62:59.280: no no no 
63:01.700: personal one where you talk to it and 
63:04.380: say hey how are you doing and their 
63:05.880: concept is like you have this one 
63:07.500: relationship so it's like one chat 
63:09.599: thread it's not kind of how like to 
63:11.700: work with the use threads and share 
63:14.579: threads with my team so I'm not fan of 
63:16.559: this like you have one relationship with 
63:17.940: one assistant think the thing is it's 
63:19.619: interesting to note that 
63:21.480: very rarely when you invest money in the 
63:24.599: billions of dollars 
63:26.339: does the capex or purchase of one 
63:29.520: specific form of equipment take up 
63:31.619: literally 
63:33.780: of the Enterprise Value that's 
63:36.059: atypical 
63:38.040: least for startup 
63:40.319: you're if you're buying fixed plant 
63:41.880: slow cash flow generating business 
63:43.859: then maybe you know bunch of that has 
63:46.140: some value so that's what stood out to 
63:48.540: and all of these things Freeburg is 
63:49.980: again increasingly this is all just 
63:52.440: pass through to Nvidia 
63:55.380: it's probably in some ways pass 
63:57.359: through to the big cloud providers so 
63:59.040: whenever see chip maker and cloud 
64:01.260: provider come together to put in lot 
64:02.880: money it's essentially round-tripping 
64:04.440: cash they're giving the money which then 
64:06.540: they use to buy their services and then 
64:08.160: you know you just you're just pumping 
64:09.599: Revenue so hope it works wishing the 
64:13.020: best but you know that's the that's what 
64:15.119: just talked about where the 
64:16.200: infrastructure companies that are 
64:18.559: increasingly 
64:20.520: looking like more commodity service 
64:22.680: providers if they don't up level with AI 
64:25.440: tooling 
64:26.599: acquiring Mosaic ML and acquiring 
64:31.020: Neva 
64:32.400: you think that that's an indication 
64:34.380: more emana to come and if so doesn't 
64:38.099: that justify The increased funding The 
64:41.339: increased valuation and the activity 
64:43.200: that we're seeing in the early stage 
64:44.339: with some of these businesses think 
64:45.780: for sure there's going to be more 
64:47.280: and think the valuations will be high 
64:49.020: not because these companies have lot 
64:50.579: Revenue yet but because it's very 
64:52.200: strategic for these big infra companies 
64:54.420: assemble the end to end 
64:56.880: tool chain think we should explain to 
64:58.980: folks what that means enterprise 
65:00.660: software companies provide software to 
65:03.480: businesses that are not traditionally 
65:04.859: technology companies they also provide 
65:06.420: software to other businesses to help 
65:08.460: them build new tools to help them build 
65:10.559: out their business so an Enterprise 
65:12.059: software company can sell to United 
65:13.500: Airlines or consult Visa or consult 
65:15.780: Ford and that software can then be used 
65:18.359: that company to build tools that are 
65:20.940: powered by the database or powered by 
65:23.760: the data analytics or increasingly 
65:25.559: powered by AI tools and so they can 
65:28.319: build AI applications and AI 
65:30.180: capabilities into their business whether 
65:32.220: it's United Airlines or Expedia or Visa 
65:35.099: whomever and that's why this these 
65:37.920: companies are so critical in terms of 
65:40.200: enabling the transformation of 
65:41.579: Industries with AI tooling and and why 
65:44.280: you know getting AI tooling into their 
65:46.079: capability set is so critical right now 
65:47.760: it's important to note though guys that 
65:49.380: whenever you have the emergence of new 
65:51.180: sector 
65:52.380: Sox think you are right that goes 
65:55.380: but it tends to be that the valuations 
65:57.180: down Peak froth happens at the 
66:00.059: beginning of the cycle when hype is at 
66:02.040: maximum and facts are at the minimum 
66:06.900: and that's okay you know that's good for 
66:08.640: the startup it's marginally negative for 
66:11.640: the existing shareholder of large 
66:13.140: company and then over time it gets 
66:15.480: itself sorted out when the facts are 
66:17.280: more obvious so yeah it's kind of like 
66:20.160: you guys remember when the optical 
66:21.420: networking craze oh my God had these 
66:24.059: multi-billion dollar Acquisitions and 
66:26.460: where did they go they went they went 
66:27.900: nowhere they just disappeared we 
66:30.299: actually have like market map that we 
66:31.920: did that think can explain this 
66:33.240: concept of end-to-end tool chain so 
66:35.940: this is slide that our growth team 
66:39.240: shout out to Mike Robinson and chemical 
66:41.400: Borough they put this together in 
66:43.319: preparation and part of the investment 
66:44.940: memo for Mosaic and think to explain 
66:48.480: the point you were kind of making 
66:49.859: Freeburg like why do Enterprises need 
66:53.220: the services one really simple way of 
66:56.099: thinking about it right now is that 
66:57.240: every Enterprise would like to roll out 
66:59.280: its own chat GPT they would all like to 
67:01.799: have their own internal version of chat 
67:03.359: GPT where their employees for example 
67:05.640: could ask questions and get answers 
67:08.099: that's where all the action is right now 
67:09.900: every Enterprise would buy that tomorrow 
67:11.819: it existed in the way 
67:15.200: sex yeah give an example the idea would 
67:17.880: that you know any employee in the 
67:19.619: company could ask questions to the AI 
67:21.539: model the way you can ask chat GPT 
67:23.160: questions and it would have all the 
67:24.780: Enterprises data and it would also 
67:26.039: understand their permissions and have 
67:27.900: all the security settings so that only 
67:30.119: there feel could get the right 
67:31.140: information that's the kind of 
67:32.819: intelligence they want to unlock mean 
67:34.619: there are lots of other use cases but 
67:36.660: that's really simple one corporate 
67:38.099: Oracle so can if I'm in HR can ask 
67:40.740: hey tell me about our you know 
67:42.480: composition yeah totally co-pilot for 
67:45.059: the CEO think there's gonna be lots of 
67:46.920: these think the sales team is gonna 
67:48.059: have their own co-pilot think the 
67:49.319: marketing team's gonna have their own 
67:50.760: co-pilot and customer support has it 
67:52.619: already yeah this customer support will 
67:54.180: have it 
67:56.059: there's gonna be lot of these but 
67:58.680: think Enterprises want one at the level 
68:00.539: the call it the company intranet 
68:02.339: where employees could just ask it 
68:03.839: questions and but they do not want to 
68:06.180: share their data with open AI That's 
68:08.160: like very clear they want to roll out 
68:09.599: their own models 
68:10.980: the question is well how do you roll 
68:12.299: out your own model and what this shows 
68:13.920: here is the different pieces of the 
68:15.180: stack that you have to have so first you 
68:16.980: capture all of your data you got to 
68:18.359: label it to be classified right for the 
68:20.699: model you've got to store it somewhere 
68:22.380: then you need to get one of these open 
68:24.719: source AI models off the shelf and 
68:26.880: there's probably the most prominent 
68:28.620: site for this called hugging face 
68:30.779: which already has something like think 
68:32.339: two billion dollar valuation that's 
68:34.440: another like really crazy valuation to 
68:37.620: ARR multiple but hugging face has kind 
68:40.500: all the open source models it's very 
68:42.239: active and so people grab the latest 
68:44.580: open source model that's the best fit 
68:46.739: for them and then they need to train 
68:48.600: that model and that's really where 
68:50.160: Mosaic played and there's ton of 
68:51.779: activity right now in this last mile 
68:54.239: problem of how do you customize model 
68:56.219: make it suitable for your use whether 
68:58.679: you're an Enterprise whether you're 
69:00.719: customer service team whether you're 
69:03.299: SAS app that wants to incorporate AI 
69:05.640: capabilities into your app that's where 
69:08.040: all the action is right now is 
69:09.480: customizing these open source models 
69:10.859: models that then leads to basically 
69:13.259: being able to get the right inferences 
69:15.839: and there's sort of separate category 
69:17.640: around Hardware that is you know we 
69:19.620: don't play there but this is kind of the 
69:21.540: end-to-end tool chain and think these 
69:22.920: big tech companies are going to be 
69:24.000: racing to put this whole thing together 
69:25.980: fill it out yeah yeah and that's so 
69:28.020: there'll be more is your prediction 
69:29.339: which means more startup valuation 
69:31.380: booming more Capital deploying there was 
69:33.600: uh 
69:35.100: couple of Articles this week and 
69:37.080: tomorrow this is your red meat as much 
69:39.660: Ukraine is Saks is 
69:41.759: because you've talked about this at 
69:43.620: length social messaging startup IRL is 
69:46.319: shutting down after board 
69:47.580: investigation found 95 percent of its 
69:49.560: claimed 20 million users were actually 
69:51.660: fake this is company that in June of 
69:53.940: 2021 raised 170 million dollar series 
69:57.120: evaluation of over billion dollars 
69:58.739: making it one of the many proclaimed 
70:00.780: unicorns of Silicon Valley led by 
70:02.400: softbanks Vision fund the investor who 
70:04.380: was sitting on the board said that they 
70:06.120: didn't know if we've ever given an 
70:08.340: investment term sheet to startup 
70:10.080: faster than SoftBank gave to IRL at the 
70:12.900: time at the same time different story 
70:14.940: but in the same week company called 
70:17.160: baiju which you have talked about in the 
70:19.860: past was once valued at 22 billion 
70:21.900: dollars and claimed to be India's most 
70:24.239: valuable startup is in turmoil as 
70:25.800: shareholders and creditors are seeking 
70:27.300: dilute the founder and he's rushing 
70:30.060: find Capital and raise billion 
70:32.520: dollars to try and buoy the company 
70:34.500: process one of the investors Mark the 
70:36.239: company's valuation down to 5.1 billion 
70:38.940: down 75 percent 
70:40.800: guess the question is overall are we 
70:43.920: still seeing this kind of turmoil in 
70:46.140: Silicon Valley from the zerp era funding 
70:49.500: startups in Stark juxtaposition to 
70:52.140: the excitement and the frenzy around AI 
70:53.699: it's characteristic of the exact same 
70:55.739: thing meaning if you replaced AI with 
70:59.580: crypto 
71:00.780: it's the exact same thing if you're 
71:02.699: placed 
71:03.840: with 
71:05.699: co-working if you replaced AI with 
71:10.920: don't know synthetic biology if you 
71:13.140: replaced AI with SAS this has all 
71:17.040: happened before think it's important 
71:18.840: identify what this is 
71:21.120: what this is is that there aren't enough 
71:23.940: checks and balances and there are 
71:25.980: fundamentally people 
71:27.659: who are deeply inexperienced who are in 
71:30.480: the wrong job 
71:32.040: and in the few key moments 
71:34.940: where the venture capitalist is supposed 
71:37.800: add value that person is ill-equipped 
71:40.500: and unprepared why because they were the 
71:42.300: of and at some startup 
71:45.179: and they got hired through no fault of 
71:47.159: their own 
71:48.900: into dynamic because these Venture 
71:50.760: funds wanted to raise larger and larger 
71:52.620: amounts of money 
71:54.480: what happens you don't even know how 
71:57.120: ask the basic questions or even more 
72:00.360: insidiously you don't have the courage 
72:01.980: say 
72:03.120: the hard thing 
72:04.920: and so these things happen that are 
72:08.640: frankly inexcusable 
72:10.739: right so in the case of one of these 
72:13.020: companies and I've mentioned this before 
72:15.540: they approached us for financing and 
72:18.300: when we asked for data room we got 
72:21.840: Google doc link to spreadsheet 
72:24.659: now there's no reasonable World in which 
72:26.880: company is that unsophisticated when 
72:29.219: comes to understanding their business 
72:31.560: right data room should include an 
72:34.739: enormous amount of operational and 
72:36.600: financial metrics that you can use to 
72:38.040: come to your own conclusion so that you 
72:40.080: can present it transparently to the 
72:42.420: investor 
72:43.679: the idea that boards wouldn't even hold 
72:46.860: these companies accountable is just 
72:48.659: sign that the board members themselves 
72:50.100: are pretty fundamentally inexperienced 
72:52.440: people 
72:53.219: and think the thing that we do which 
72:55.199: mistake is we say oh well and 
72:57.900: firm LED this deal yeah that may be true 
73:01.140: but really what it means is that firm 
73:05.400: grab to get the money 
73:07.980: hired some person that checked some 
73:10.020: boxes put them in the job that person 
73:12.719: LED around and there just wasn't any 
73:15.600: infrastructure to either teach that 
73:17.699: person or then that person to have the 
73:20.280: courage to hold the founder responsible 
73:21.960: that will play out in AI as well it's 
73:24.540: just that we're at the beginning of the 
73:25.860: hype cycle 
73:26.940: right because we replace AI again as 
73:30.000: said with any of these other things we 
73:31.380: sat here 
73:32.640: little bit hand-wringing when we saw 
73:34.500: these crazy valuations for these nft 
73:36.239: projects where are those now 
73:38.159: right so you name it zero this is about 
73:41.280: fundamentally inexperienced people doing 
73:44.280: job that seems pretty easy from the 
73:46.260: outside 
73:47.340: but in Practical reality there are only 
73:49.320: few Legends in our business most 
73:51.659: people and think it was shy Goldman 
73:53.219: that did the math on this most people do 
73:55.620: not know how to run these businesses 
73:57.120: well Nick will find that tweet you can 
73:59.940: show 
74:00.780: think it's like two and half percent 
74:02.580: all of the funds that are in 
74:05.219: pitchbook so over 800 of them have ever 
74:07.260: generated more than 3x and two funds 
74:10.199: this is hard business it turns out 
74:12.600: you can't just wake up and be an 
74:13.980: investor it turns out and 
74:16.440: that's what we're finding so don't 
74:18.300: know it's not very surprising in the end 
74:19.739: none of this is surprising 
74:21.440: had really good point in the middle 
74:23.400: there is that there is generation of 
74:25.260: venture capitalists who were added 
74:26.640: during the boom who were operators but 
74:28.739: they've never been taught to have the 
74:30.239: discipline of capital allocators and one 
74:33.000: those key pieces of discipline is 
74:35.100: asking uncomfortable questions and doing 
74:37.320: uncomfortable 
74:39.060: diligence and you can trust people but 
74:42.659: you need to verify that is key part of 
74:45.120: the job you can trust the founders but 
74:47.580: you have to verify that the data you 
74:49.140: have is correct 
74:50.400: the fact that SoftBank did is that 
74:52.199: incredible valuation and the person who 
74:54.600: did this deal never checked that the 
74:58.080: customers were real 
75:00.060: uh makes you unfit to serve in the 
75:03.420: job and will do diligence and during 
75:06.300: that time period Freeburg had many 
75:08.760: Founders say to me you're asking for 
75:10.920: more diligence than the lead and this 
75:13.199: deal is closing and we are over 
75:15.300: subscribed and said okay and they said 
75:18.300: okay so you're not gonna you're not 
75:19.920: going to require assistance said oh no 
75:21.000: require this diligence we want to see 
75:22.620: your you know very basic stuff your bank 
75:25.260: statements your we want to talk to 
75:27.360: why don't you give us list of your 
75:28.800: first thousand give us list of 500 
75:31.500: customers from last month we'll give you 
75:32.940: five numbers we're going to talk to five 
75:34.199: random customers like people did not 
75:35.940: want to do this stuff we do that this 
75:37.380: work at our firm when we start to own 
75:39.060: five ten percent of this and we train 
75:40.800: our Founders to do to be ready for 
75:42.840: proper diligence all that diligence is 
75:44.580: happening now now in the early stages 
75:46.199: there's not much to go on but you can 
75:48.300: check stuff 
75:49.380: during this period people Founders used 
75:52.380: the hot Market to not 
75:55.620: participate in the due diligence process 
75:57.600: and when you look at companies 
75:59.940: lot of times people will suspend 
76:01.860: disbelief you know this company uh buy 
76:03.960: you don't know ton about it but it 
76:05.820: seems to have 
76:07.380: you know like an educational app like 
76:09.239: company brilliant.org that chamoth and 
76:11.400: are um early investors in and Jama 
76:13.980: incubated 
76:15.719: great great business 
76:17.460: um and but then their business and their 
76:19.140: revenue seems to be based on series of 
76:21.360: like Kumon like in-person instruction oh 
76:24.540: that's not high gross margin business 
76:25.980: sorry if you have to have storefront 
76:28.320: you're not software business anymore 
76:30.080: and so people started giving valuations 
76:33.179: and this is the second part and I'll 
76:34.320: just wrap on this people started giving 
76:35.520: valuations to these companies that were 
76:37.320: real world businesses that were low 
76:38.940: margin businesses direct to Consumer 
76:41.219: whatever it was they suspended disbelief 
76:43.080: and they gave them valuations for high 
76:46.320: growth 
76:47.699: high gross margin businesses and that 
76:49.860: was another mistake and you put those 
76:51.300: two things together 
76:52.560: not doing diligence and then just 
76:55.080: misvaluing of actual assets that's the 
76:58.140: cleanup work that's been that's going on 
77:00.000: right now and it takes years mean it 
77:01.739: took decades for them to pinch Bernie 
77:04.199: Madoff it can take 10 years for these 
77:06.719: frauds to come out there was guy who 
77:08.580: kept telling the SEC about Bernie Madoff 
77:10.380: think he was like nine years since the 
77:12.719: first time he he let them know 
77:14.940: that the you know perfect returns were 
77:17.280: just not possible statistically 
77:19.320: it it takes time but they're they're 
77:21.600: picking these uh Folks up everywhere 
77:24.120: dokwan got picked up at Montenegro you 
77:26.219: know the guy from Luna 
77:27.659: and it's going to take decade to clean 
77:29.820: all of the fraud in our space think 
77:32.760: this was sort of mentioned by chamoth 
77:34.320: but think it needs to be bigger 
77:35.400: point which is the influence of fund 
77:37.679: size on these decisions 
77:39.780: mean crash funds are in the six to 
77:42.659: seven hundred million range so when we 
77:44.640: write check it's usually 10 15 20 
77:46.860: million dollar check in series 
77:49.140: company 
77:50.820: that's like big check for us we're 
77:52.620: really going to sweat that decision for 
77:54.600: SoftBank at 10 to 20 million dollar 
77:56.219: check in hundred billion dollar fund 
77:58.739: which is what they had 
78:00.239: doesn't even make sense it's waste 
78:01.920: their time it's not even rounding 
78:03.540: error for them to basically make ten 
78:06.900: thousand dollar check for you yeah 
78:08.520: exactly so for them they had to write 
78:10.620: 200 million dollar checks if to justify 
78:13.560: their time managing 100 billion dollars 
78:15.540: and so the mistake when they make 
78:17.880: mistake is 20 times bigger than it 
78:19.800: should be that should have been maybe 
78:21.540: million mistake not 200 million 
78:24.060: dollar mistake but their Fun Size force 
78:26.580: them to basically write these gigantic 
78:28.620: checks and they're writing them into 
78:29.880: companies that were effectively seed 
78:32.100: stage or series companies if it was 
78:34.199: into growth stage company think 
78:36.060: that's fine there's lot more data and 
78:38.219: there's lot more customer references 
78:40.020: that you can check at later Stage 
78:41.400: Company by the way the number one part 
78:43.440: diligence I'd say for us other than 
78:45.120: looking at metrics which is anyone can 
78:47.520: is the offsheet references talking to 
78:50.520: customers from list that you figured 
78:53.280: out yourself not from the company itself 
78:55.560: probably the single most important 
78:57.659: qualitative part of of diligence 
79:00.659: don't know what happened here but 
79:02.340: it's not stated explicitly but think 
79:04.620: it's important David you have 
79:05.880: credibility So when you say something 
79:08.280: sucks people listen because you have 
79:10.080: Bona fides that are undeniable 
79:12.600: same thing with jcal same thing with you 
79:14.400: Freeburg think you know and this may 
79:16.140: sound mean but it's like most of these 
79:17.940: people 
79:18.780: are just XYZ mid-level VPS from 
79:22.080: startup and that's great thing 
79:24.480: but it's not necessarily going to give 
79:27.360: you the gravitas especially if that's 
79:29.280: not what you were forced to do to help 
79:31.380: build that company and when push comes 
79:33.900: shove inside of boardroom or in the 
79:36.659: middle of diligence 
79:38.400: there has to be conflict think it's 
79:40.739: necessary feature of good decisions and 
79:43.140: that conflict arises internally within 
79:45.060: your investment team but it also has to 
79:46.980: come externally with the executives of 
79:49.380: the startup and with the CEO themselves 
79:51.239: because when you're Prosecuting good 
79:53.040: decision it's unbelievable that you 
79:54.719: agree on 100 of things and there has to 
79:56.580: certain things that are controversial 
79:58.080: otherwise by definition that company 
79:59.699: isn't really even pushing the boundary 
80:01.920: just think that these are all 
80:04.739: skills that are poorly taught 
80:07.140: while you are building business it is 
80:09.420: not the reason why you should have been 
80:11.400: charge of allocating 50 and 100 
80:13.380: million dollar checks into companies 
80:14.820: that is just crazy town 
80:16.920: love your point sacks though about Fun 
80:19.020: Size Dynamics Fun Size Dynamics our 
80:21.360: destiny right it really is and and the 
80:24.239: optimal Fun Size for Venture is 
80:26.520: somewhere between 250 and 600 million 
80:30.000: according to everybody who's been doing 
80:32.100: this for you know more than decade or 
80:34.920: two and who's successful whether it's 
80:36.300: when the costs are coming down so as the 
80:37.920: input costs come down whether it's for 
80:39.300: engineers and co-pilots and and hardware 
80:41.820: and abstraction layers then 
80:43.260: theoretically 
80:44.520: greater outcomes should be generated 
80:46.260: with fewer dollars in which would again 
80:48.900: tell you that fund sizes should actually 
80:50.699: down not up that the reason they go 
80:52.620: is because you get paid an annual 
80:54.540: management fee and so obviously the way 
80:56.580: wait the way to make more money is to 
80:59.100: get two percent on larger fixed number 
81:01.080: every year versus two percent on 
81:02.940: smaller number or you know for example 
81:05.280: what we did was we were like we're gonna 
81:07.020: and hit grand slams and so traded 
81:10.020: off management fee in return for 30 
81:12.360: carry and that turned out to be 
81:14.840: literally multi-billion dollar smart 
81:18.060: decision because gave up tens of 
81:19.920: millions of dollars up front for back 
81:21.840: end now the back end could have gone to 
81:23.580: zero and maybe it still can so who knows 
81:25.800: but you know most folks wouldn't do that 
81:28.800: most folks take the sort of 
81:30.239: risk-adjusted bet and say you know what 
81:32.400: I'll just take the two percent and I'll 
81:33.840: raise 200 million then 500 million 
81:35.940: then billion then two billion 
81:37.620: dollars 
81:38.880: yeah and they stack them all and they 
81:40.620: get the two percent and all of sudden 
81:41.880: the profits don't matter which means the 
81:43.440: outcomes don't matter which means the 
81:45.239: diligence is perfunctory and it becomes 
81:47.400: theatrical expose that you can use you 
81:51.719: know this sort of thin fig Leaf you can 
81:53.640: point to LPS and say we did our work 
81:56.580: here give us more money for this next 
81:58.320: fund that's the rat race that the 
82:00.179: Venture Community is in and it's going 
82:02.219: get played out in companies like IRL 
82:04.140: and baijus and lot of these AI 
82:06.060: companies quite honestly well and it the 
82:08.040: chickens have come home tours for all 
82:09.420: the questions is not different is 
82:11.580: think what I'm trying to say this time 
82:12.840: not different did you guys see there 
82:14.580: was some article that reported that 
82:17.100: fundraising for late stage funds is just 
82:19.140: like cratered dead so Insight was trying 
82:22.199: raise 10 billion dollar fund and 
82:23.699: they've only been able to raise two 
82:24.840: according to this article no no it was 
82:26.880: was 22 down to 10 and of which 
82:28.980: they've raised two okay so 10 and then 
82:31.739: tiger was trying to raise 12 they cut it 
82:34.679: six and then they can only raise two 
82:36.540: makes sense yeah so basically that's 
82:39.960: like whatever uh 80 to 90 reduction in 
82:43.860: the size of these funds yeah meanwhile 
82:45.300: the sovereigns where they were going for 
82:47.100: this money or buying sports teams 
82:48.540: they're like you know what instead of 
82:49.920: tech let's just buy sports teams and 
82:51.600: they're buying series and they're 
82:53.760: buying Manchester United and they're 
82:55.140: buying distressed portfolios yeah and 
82:57.300: the but there's sovereign crunch 
82:58.980: there's huge we've talked about it 
83:00.179: before but there's huge crunch in late 
83:01.440: stage financing it's only going to get 
83:02.940: worse over the next 18 months asked 
83:05.760: Brad last week like how many of these 
83:07.500: zombie courts do you think there are 
83:09.000: these are the 1400 he said 30 to 40 
83:11.699: percent yeah think he might be you 
83:13.860: know it could be look out of 1400 
83:16.080: think it could be 700 or zombie coins 
83:17.880: think it's at least 700 think think 
83:19.860: it's probably 60 yeah it's and then the 
83:22.679: other 40 let's say how many of them have 
83:25.500: Down Round coming think 60 go to 
83:28.260: zero 
83:29.760: the remaining 40 half of them 
83:32.640: probably return money 
83:34.860: and then of the remaining half half of 
83:37.500: those maybe get one and half 
83:40.020: and then you get geometric 
83:41.520: distribution from there which means the 
83:43.199: Blended return of that entire stream of 
83:45.179: unicorns will be about 1.1 but it'll 
83:48.120: very massively distributed think 
83:49.860: that is exactly right tomorrow would 
83:51.960: yeah everybody's getting their money 
83:53.760: back except if you don't have 
83:55.260: diversification yeah it's it's the 
83:57.659: think the market is sending very clear 
83:59.159: message which is these are usage 
84:02.580: everybody's getting no no no most people 
84:04.260: won't get their money most people get 
84:05.460: their money back but on average it's 
84:07.380: going to be one extra turn yeah so it's 
84:08.820: not going to be evenly distributed 
84:09.900: correct 
84:10.860: well I'm glad that the term zombie corn 
84:12.780: has held guys um we are coming up on our 
84:15.540: time do you guys want to do science 
84:16.800: corner or do you want to 
84:19.260: yeah the three of us need to use the 
84:20.820: bathroom break so go ahead and just 
84:24.179: you could just go do it we're gonna 
84:25.620: and take leak and we'll come back 
84:27.239: and make Uranus joke 
84:31.100: look it's been great it's been great 
84:33.480: being your host we crashed yourself give 
84:35.460: the science quitter give us you don't 
84:37.020: hug me you don't embrace me you know 
84:38.880: you're gonna love my contribution free 
84:40.920: book actually posted clip of RFK 
84:43.980: talking about vaccines I'd love for you 
84:45.840: listen to it and actually give us the 
84:47.340: critique 
84:48.360: yes will 
84:50.360: that's going viral right now he did such 
84:52.739: good job explaining his position on 
84:54.300: that he did such good job yeah look do 
84:57.060: you guys read the offit piece forward 
84:58.980: to you and said please read this 
85:01.620: you guys read that piece I'll watch 
85:03.719: his clip and let's talk about it next 
85:04.980: week is that cool 
85:07.219: yeah he is vaccine scientist who RFK 
85:10.739: references often as someone that he 
85:13.560: met with and spoke with and says 
85:14.940: caught him in lie and often basically 
85:16.920: said here's exactly what happened here's 
85:18.719: the conversation here's the data here's 
85:20.820: the fact here's the science 
85:22.679: and would really really encourage you 
85:25.080: guys to read that please 
85:27.060: and then I'll watch his clip and like 
85:28.800: let's have real kind of analytical 
85:30.659: conversation about statements that are 
85:33.719: good questions to ask and good things to 
85:35.640: interrogate and things that are being 
85:37.380: said that maybe aren't factually correct 
85:40.020: and think that we need to kind of 
85:41.340: really as service to ourselves and to 
85:43.620: people that listen to us really do that 
85:45.300: work 
85:46.140: let's do that and come back and talk 
85:47.699: about it next week if that's cool 
85:49.739: but I'd encourage everyone to read often 
85:51.420: put it on substack Nick we'll put the 
85:53.580: link in the the notes Here continue 
85:56.600: dialogue continue exactly think that's 
85:58.739: the most important you want to talk 
85:59.699: about that certain Senator that all of 
86:01.260: sudden just basically gave us the 
86:03.179: Heisman no we've had lot of those by 
86:05.280: the way so let me just be clear that's 
86:06.840: not the only Heisman we've received on 
86:08.460: the all in Summit will say that the 
86:10.980: speaker list for the all-in summit it's 
86:13.440: looking fantastic 
86:16.820: we're gonna have great time 
86:19.139: and I'm really excited for the 
86:20.639: conversation but you're saying some 
86:22.020: folks Heisman does because of our 
86:24.480: support of RFK 
86:26.400: that did happen and specifically the 
86:29.460: fact that that's really open-minded yeah 
86:31.500: and then there were other folks who were 
86:33.540: insulted by things or said about them by 
86:36.420: people on the show So Soft you guys want 
86:38.520: hear about the the nanograph release 
86:41.460: that came out yesterday okay I'll cover 
86:42.900: this one real quick what about this like 
86:44.880: slow Hummer that we're all getting what 
86:46.320: that that's it it's slow Hummer 
86:48.239: exactly okay are you talking about like 
86:51.239: the new H3 EV but it only goes up to 50 
86:53.580: miles per hour 
86:55.020: what is that the new Hummer the new HV 
86:57.719: you know they have an EV they're coming 
86:59.880: out with an EV event oh you're kidding 
87:01.620: it's hilarious yeah it's like great 
87:03.480: troll remember when Schwarzenegger got 
87:05.639: the Hummer back in the 90s and 
87:06.960: everyone's like oh my God it's amazing 
87:09.260: and then the Hummer was the coolest car 
87:11.520: drive yeah 
87:16.860: Okay so yesterday paper was published 
87:20.280: an international 
87:22.560: scientific Consortium this group is 
87:24.600: called nanograph 
87:26.340: and they've been using series of 
87:27.960: instruments to measure pulsars including 
87:31.320: 500 meter radio telescope array 
87:34.560: which allows them to see what's so 
87:37.679: funny no just had like three Uranus 
87:40.620: jumps one sentence and had to stop 
87:42.480: myself 
87:44.120: the nanograph data that was released is 
87:47.219: years of data from pulsars and 
87:49.920: pulsars are neutron stars which are 
87:52.139: stars that have collapsed on themselves 
87:53.880: and are basically super dense and start 
87:55.679: spinning and then these pulsars you know 
87:58.020: you basically like lighthouse you can 
87:59.880: see the light so it looks like almost 
88:01.320: like strobe light and we can see 
88:03.719: thousands of these Across the Universe 
88:05.400: and we can observe them and the rate at 
88:07.920: which the pulsing is coming out of these 
88:09.960: pulsars tells us lot about what is 
88:12.780: happening in the space between Earth and 
88:16.020: those pulsars and when you collect 
88:18.120: enough data over long enough period of 
88:20.159: time which is what these folks have just 
88:21.840: released as 15 years worth of this data 
88:23.880: you can start to see really interesting 
88:27.540: patterns in the data that support the 
88:31.560: theory that space time itself is slowly 
88:36.659: vibrating being stretched being 
88:38.460: compressed being pulled apart being 
88:40.500: pushed back together because of very 
88:42.960: large gravitational events happening 
88:45.179: around the universe and what that means 
88:47.340: you guys have all seen 
88:49.139: you know that kind of two-dimensional 
88:50.940: image of black hole and Nick if you 
88:52.679: could find one online and pull it up 
88:54.000: where it looks like hey at the middle of 
88:55.500: black hole space itself collapses in 
88:57.600: and it collapses down and what happens 
88:59.460: space and time gets significantly 
89:02.219: elongated when they're really close to 
89:04.440: gravity gravity actually pulls space 
89:06.480: sucks it in sucks in time and it becomes 
89:09.480: distorted and so when you have large 
89:12.179: black holes around the universe spinning 
89:14.460: and running past each other they're 
89:16.560: actually pulling and stretching space 
89:18.300: time itself and that sends out ripples 
89:20.699: throughout the Universe ripples that are 
89:23.340: slowly undulating space and time itself 
89:27.120: by observing all of these pulsars 
89:29.460: around the universe and the rate at 
89:31.800: which these pulsars are pulsing and 
89:33.900: seeing slight variations we can start to 
89:37.020: measure and actually see those waves 
89:39.840: those very slow waves of space time 
89:43.080: itself undulating and being pushed and 
89:45.960: compressed and so it supports Einstein's 
89:48.540: general theory of relativity which 
89:50.340: indicated that space-time itself can be 
89:52.260: warped by gravity and it provides 
89:54.960: really interesting picture on the 
89:56.340: universe itself that all around us we 
89:59.460: have large masses that are many many 
90:01.980: millions or billions of light years away 
90:03.659: that are creating waves in space and 
90:06.420: time itself that we as humans will never 
90:08.880: kind of observe realize or feel 
90:10.920: ourselves but as part of the fabric and 
90:13.080: the underlying nature of our universe 
90:15.480: with space and time being slowly warped 
90:18.000: and slowly elongated slowly compressed 
90:20.219: and it's really fascinating picture of 
90:22.560: the universe over time as scientists 
90:24.719: gather more and more of this data 
90:26.699: will provide insights into where in 
90:29.400: the universe these massive black hole 
90:31.080: events May Be occurring and also provide 
90:33.600: insights into the early picture and the 
90:35.400: large-scale structure of the universe 
90:37.020: which helps us better understand how 
90:39.239: everything started and where we're all 
90:41.040: coming from so it was really 
90:42.600: fascinating data release think it's 
90:45.239: really kind of profound thing if you 
90:46.620: take little time and think about it 
90:48.300: it's super exciting it's getting lot 
90:50.400: press coverage today and 
90:52.679: encourage us all to pull our heads out 
90:54.659: the Ukraine war and Silicon Valley 
90:56.520: and money and all this stuff and realize 
90:58.620: that there are things of extraordinary 
90:59.940: scale and structure that are that are 
91:01.260: happening around us let me ask you two 
91:02.580: questions 
91:03.659: number one why does it matter 
91:06.420: and number two any theories here of what 
91:09.719: might discover you know if this you 
91:12.840: know goes 10x or 100x in terms of the 
91:15.540: the information we're getting many years 
91:17.159: ago it was theorized that there's what's 
91:19.560: called cosmic microwave background 
91:21.420: radiation the CMB and what that is it's 
91:25.260: the leftover heat from the formation of 
91:28.080: the Universe from the universe when the 
91:29.460: Big Bang happened yep and these 
91:31.500: scientists figured out how to create 
91:32.520: really sensitive radio telescopes and um 
91:35.520: put them in the the uh in orbit and they 
91:38.159: started to observe the background 
91:40.139: radiation and what that showed us was 
91:42.420: the fingerprint of the universe the 
91:44.159: original structure of the universe that 
91:46.380: created ultimately all the galaxies 
91:48.000: super galaxies and then ultimately all 
91:50.040: the stars and then the planets and 
91:51.239: everything that that came from that 
91:53.100: this could be the beginning of seeing 
91:55.920: gravitational background of the universe 
91:58.500: where we could actually start to see 
92:00.360: perhaps the fingerprint of the 
92:02.699: space-time 
92:03.960: the whole universe of what the actual 
92:06.360: structure of space itself and time 
92:08.400: itself looks like throughout the 
92:09.659: Universe with the perturbations being 
92:11.520: driven by some very large massive 
92:13.739: supermassive black holes there was 
92:15.420: black hole discovered this week that's 
92:16.620: billion times the mass of our sun 
92:20.480: there are these massive objects out 
92:22.800: there that are actively distorting 
92:24.659: space-time and we're going to start to 
92:26.400: get fingerprint of that with this sort 
92:28.139: data and over time that just gives us 
92:30.659: better sense of what the overall 
92:32.400: structure of the universe looks like not 
92:34.199: just from the heat energy that we're 
92:35.639: collecting but also the gravitational 
92:37.020: waves that we're now able to observe 
92:39.300: through the inference of this data 
92:40.920: collection let's just make deepens our 
92:42.480: understanding of the universe but 
92:43.920: there's no structure of the universe 
92:44.880: yeah which is amazing and interesting 
92:47.219: but and and it validates and proves the 
92:50.219: general theory of relativity which if 
92:51.840: you think about the application of that 
92:53.460: down the road that may lead to things 
92:55.440: like close to or as fast as like travel 
92:58.199: things related to time travel or you 
93:01.199: know there's lot of things that people 
93:02.639: have theorized for decades about 
93:05.219: you know black holes and the warping of 
93:07.620: space-time itself I'm not saying that 
93:09.719: any of this stuff is did you see the 
93:11.219: three body problem trailer 
93:13.260: yeah it looks amazing it looks 
93:15.239: amazing it's amazing what great what 
93:17.880: great can't believe we have to wait so 
93:19.139: long hate it when they put out 
93:20.100: trailers so how long when is it coming 
93:22.380: out next year oh wow yeah oh still 
93:26.219: haven't seen your movie the guys your 
93:28.199: movie that you wanted me to see 
93:30.300: which one better try oh everything 
93:32.040: everywhere all at once got better 
93:33.659: movie for you got great pull for you 
93:35.699: it's on Pay-per-view right now the 
93:38.159: movie call about BlackBerry 
93:40.739: tells the story of black oh heard 
93:42.540: it's like an independent film it is 
93:44.460: awesome 
93:45.900: just reviewed it on this week in 
93:47.340: startups it's called just on his 
93:49.020: BlackBerry called Blackberry yeah 
93:52.080: think okay well guys this has been 
93:53.760: episodes amazing 135 of the all-in Pod 
93:57.239: really appreciate it 
93:58.739: are oh my God my time together just 
94:01.320: enough time to get you back to your 
94:03.000: Nirvana concert 
94:04.560: Leo 
94:06.239: what's the background on this one is 
94:07.980: that rival what is that what's that 
94:09.960: background what movie that's black 
94:12.719: hole that's black hole just black 
94:14.580: hole okay 
94:15.780: think that that's from 
94:18.780: might be event might be matter with 
94:20.400: Sax's hair because he looks like did you 
94:21.780: get it cut sacks he got cut did you 
94:24.719: cut it no you broke got mild 
94:27.840: sloughing shower show us the floor let's 
94:30.420: let's see 
94:36.860: just keep growing it out man Jacob you 
94:39.179: want to take us out you do better 
94:40.560: outro all right everybody for David
